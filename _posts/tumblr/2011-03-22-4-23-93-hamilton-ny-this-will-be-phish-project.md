4/23/93 - HAMILTON, NY
This will be #phish project show 56: 4/23/93, Hamilton, NY, Reid Athletic Center. Back in the NE after 2 months and 10 days.
4/23/93: RT @Jwabrit13: [Reid Athletic Center] is the gym/basketball court at Colgate. Big tarp on floor for show. #crowdsourcing
4/23/93: You can hear that sports arena echo on this tape - jarring after a week+ in theaters. Early Jim and Sparkle for the arena crowd.
4/23/93: First Melt since the Columbus breakthrough; the idea-trading interplay returns, though this one is more tightly coiled.
4/23/93 Correction: RT @Jwabrit13: It fit about 2500. Not an arena. Just a big gym.
4/23/93: Fluffhead really never changes (except in flub #), but Trey does a cool feedback thing briefly in the “Clod” segment that I dig.
4/23/93: Spoke too soon - Fluff ends w/ acoustic outro, segues into MFMF. Just like the 3/12 Fluff > Horse.
4/23/93: Was gonna whine about Fluff and Divided Sky being in the same set, but then Divided was pretty epic & awesome. Guess I needed one.
4/23/93: All four band members individually dedicate Lawn Boy to Fish’s parents. Can’t quite tell if that’s sweet or creepy.
4/23/93: 2nd Curtis Loew of tour, and the 2nd-to-last for 16 years. According to Wiki, this is the store from the song: http://bit.ly/fVGMVG
4/23/93: Big empty space in the middle of It’s Ice - Page pokes, Fish taps, crowd claps. This set can’t really find traction.
4/23/93: Things finally lurch to life with Mike’s - Trey plays frisky hopscotch through the first jam, but 2nd jam riffs out and sinks.
4/23/93: Trey steers the band on to a side-path right from the start of the Paug jam, hijacking tempo into a more delicate space. Niiice.
4/23/93: This Weekapaug is v. impressive - uses the same quiet jamming trick, but finds interesting microfunk & melodic curlicues there.
4/23/93: Mimi Fishman on the vacuum for “Lengthwise.” Actual quote - “Just keep blowing, Mom.” #eww
4/23/93: There’s someone whistling in the audience who sounds exactly like Trey’s ‘99 “squeaky toy” keyboard effect. #foreshadowing
4/23/93: Highway to Hell and Fire covers to close the show = let’s just rawk. No acapella in the gym.
4/23/93 verdict: Love that Weekapaug. First set is sneaky good too. Other than a lull at the start of the 2nd, v. solid show.
