  8/17/93 - KANSAS CITY, KS
  Slow pre-holiday week, so let’s do 8/17/93, Kansas City, KS, Memorial Hall. 7th show in a row without an off day, brutal.
  8/17/93: Soundcheck bonus! Though this one fades in sounding like they’re stuck in Generic Jamband auto-pilot.
  8/17/93: The actual show begins with 2 solid minutes of the Wilson chord w/ no singing. Pre-chant, that’s a pretty ominous opener.
  8/17/93: Trey putting the siren/drone effect he was practicing in the soundcheck to work right away in this Llama. Fun to hear.
  8/17/93: Not much room to open up so far in this set, but they’re sprinkling some variation into the nooks and crannies of Guelah, Divided.
  8/17/93: The days of Weigh in rotation are numbered…after this version, it’s 12/30/93 then once every 50 shows or so.
  8/17/93: And so of course they play the first ever post-Weigh jam I’ve ever heard, 30 seconds of sparkles bridging the gap to Maze.
  8/17/93: Good dose of barely audible weird chatter in the Maze intro, courtesy of Trey on megaphone. Love the BAWC.
  8/17/93: Divided and Fluffhead share a set again, sigh. Funny that this era of the band played their *hardest* songs when tired.
  8/17/93: Not usually a Phish-ballad fan, but FEFY is the palate cleanser my ears needed after all that composition.
  8/17/93: I should have counted the # of “Don’t do anything we wouldn’t do” pre-setbreak advisories. Oh well.
  8/17/93: 18-minute long David Bowie with very brief hi-hat intro, you officially have me intrigued…
  8/17/93: Deep into Bowie improv, feels more incremental and focused than recent long excursions. Trey returning to drone experiments.
  8/17/93: A shift into power chords and faster tempo just when things were feeling flat, right around 10:45. Couple strong minutes there.
  8/17/93: Little bit of Bowie teasing on acoustic before Trey strikes up The Horse (cc @bizarchive)
  8/17/93: Always strange to find a mid-set Suzy, but the placement allows for a mellower Page-led jam segment.
  8/17/93: Attn @originalwyllys and other YEM ambient section lovers — pretty good one right here.
  8/17/93: More patient iteration in the YEM jam as they spin variants on a brief, three-note theme then move into frantic minimalism.
  8/17/93: Verrrry slooooow transition into the vocal jam. Obladi Oblada references fit into the usual syllabic nonsense all too well.
  8/17/93: Both 2001 and Purple Rain/vacuum return during this set, after a couple nights off. Fair enough.
  8/17/93: My Sweet One instead of Big Ball Jam fakeout, but it’s so sloppy I think audience members are still controlling the band.
  8/17/93: I like this new trend of Trey telling the crowd to be quiet with his megaphone before no-mics acapella numbers.
