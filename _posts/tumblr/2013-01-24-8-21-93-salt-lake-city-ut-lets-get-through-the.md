  8/21/93 - SALT LAKE CITY, UT
  Let’s get through the lull between Xmas and NYE with 8/21/93, Salt Lake City, UT, Saltair Pavilion. No Dark Side this time (I think).
  8/21/93: A very AUD-y source that opens with Buried Alive > Poor Heart and Foam. Vintage like an old pair of slippers.
  8/21/93: Staying tuned to Radio Phish with Guelah and Rift. Some secret language in Guelah, just to filter out the SLC noobs.
  8/21/93: The pent-up creativity finds its release in Stash, threaded through with car alarm tones, power-chord crunch and Mike melodies.
  8/21/93: Worth remembering from time to time that Sparkle is a really paranoid, misanthropic song.
  8/21/93: Last Landlady of the year, and it looks like horn-less or non-PYITE-embedded versions are now on the endangered list.
  8/21/93: A very formulaic ‘93 first set gets a late curveball with a Runaway Jim closer, which is heart-racingly noisy and deconstructive.
  8/21/93: I’ve often commented that they didn’t seem to know what to do with Jim in ‘93, but this one…this one is good.
  8/21/93: The last time Possum opened up a second set was the 4/21/93 show with the “Demand” Melt. Promising.
  8/21/93: If you are a guy who likes peak after peak after peak, check out this Possum. (I’m not that guy)
  8/21/93: And the Flecktones come out for a post-Fee jam, marking the first time in a decade I’ve thought of “Future Man”.
  8/21/93: Smooth move to bring the Flecktones out for Llama instead of the more predictable Uncle Pen. Sounds a little cluttered though.
  8/21/93: “What happens when two jambands show up in Salt Lake City” sounds like a joke setup, but they sound pretty nimble together so far.
  8/21/93: Not too many guests try to keep up with the composed section of David Bowie. Other than the double bass, it’s pretty tolerable.
  RT @dmg924 @phishcrit @bourgwick I met Victor Wooten in ‘95 and asked him about that show. Only response - “Amazin’ musicians, man…..”
  8/21/93: Bowie spent some time in Allman-ish territory with Trey and Bela interweaving, now more free but still driving, cohesive.
  8/21/93: I guess the punchline to my joke setup a few minutes back is A: “They play Mind Left Body jam”. OK, needs some work.
  8/21/93: OK, this Hood jam w/ the Flecktones is an over-percussioned mess. But I’ll forgive them after that surprisingly nimble Bowie.
  8/21/93: Ugh, a second round of scat-singing in Daniel. I think maybe this guest appearance has run its course.
  8/21/93 verdict: Well that was a long guest sit-in, yet a fairly unique/successful one. Bowie was ++, but I’m more into the first set Jim.
