7/31/93 - ATLANTA, GA
In the final hours before new Phish, here’s some old Phish. 7/31/93, Atlanta, GA, Masquerade Music Park. 
7/31/93: Only 5 months after Roxy craziness, it’s much calmer in the ATL. Open w/ promos for the last album (Rift) and the next (Sample). 
7/31/93: Melt smolders but doesn’t ignite. I need to do a scientific analysis of whether night 5 of a 5-night run is consistently blah. 
7/31/93: Oh me of little faith. An unusual Foam, with scratchy intro and stretched-out quiet jamming, brings a little novelty. 
7/31/93: “Get some cold water or something.” #treytalks #treyadvice 
7/31/93: No 2001 for the second time since it’s debut in favor of a pre-chanting Wilson. Gets weird for about 2 seconds before > Jim. 
7/31/93: More James Bond teases from Page in It’s Ice. Easier to get away with that in the days before instant downloads. #streetsofcairo 
7/31/93: Ice floats nicely into Maze intro. This is a pretty paranoid set, really. 
7/31/93: Heartbreaker teases in Mike’s Song sound right at home. There are weirdly a lot of Phish songs that you can play that riff over. 
7/31/93: Cool second Mike’s jam moves through a couple distinct segments, then 1/2 the band starts Leprechaun and 1/2 starts Hydrogen. #oops 
7/31/93: Aw bummer, this is the last Leprechaun. Ripe for a bustout, hint hint wink wink @phish. 
7/31/93: Huh, Weekapaug has really withered back to Type I uniformity after those great April/May versions. Funny how that happens. 
7/31/93: I joke about the 2001 frequency, but there are others close. Daniel: 8 out of 14 July shows. Purple Rain: ditto. Free Bird: 7/14. 
7/31/93: On the flipside, first AC/DC Bag of the summer leads off the encore. Older Bags sound so fast/cluttered to me. 
7/31/93 verdict: Nary a hint of the madness to come; it would make more sense if 2/20/93 and this show had swapped places. Bring on August!
