7/28/93 - CHARLOTTE, NC
Starting 7/28/93, Charlotte, NC, Grady Cole Center. Grady Cole was a morning radio guy, apparently: http://bit.ly/M0u1KA

7/28/93: So cruel that I can’t find the soundcheck, which according to @phishnet included 2 Foreigner songs *and* “Working for the Weekend”

7/28/93: Venue named for radio guy -> “All Things Reconsidered” opener. Well played, if intentional.

7/28/93: Some good sustained Trey capital-N Notes in Jim, but it remains straightforward, other than a fumbled dismount.

7/28/93: Another crowd where only the coolest fans know Sample.

7/28/93: Nice evil Nellie Kane teases used as the jump-off for the Melt jam, which is lean but interesting. Dronier than usual. Belewish.

7/28/93: Coastin’ to setbreak with Horsilent, Poor Heart, Cavern. Fishman’s robust “Hey!”s in Poor Heart are the only deviance.

7/28/93: Hey guys, you’ll never guess what opens Set II! The 10th consecutive 2001 is the first one played indoors, FWIW. #lights

7/28/93: The band tries segueing 2001 into Axilla, aka The Song That Is Impossible To Start. Doesn’t work.

7/28/93: Lots going on in this Antelope: stop-start jamming, Trey & Mike flying in and out of unison, quietude pre-lyrics. Ideas aplenty.

7/28/93: Page gives his Lizards solo a little extra spice here; the rest of the band drops way back in deference.

7/28/93: Some hilariously off-tempo crowd clapping in Lizards, perhaps inspiring the subsequent Mound, where they do a much better job.

7/28/93: “Aw fuck!” secret language instead of “Mife” and laughter at the end of MFMF.

7/28/93: Hoods from this era are weird - a little tentative, aimless, but charming. This one needs a little push to the peak but I dig.

7/28/93: This is a really long Great Gig in the Sky.

7/28/93: Two consecutive Chalkdusts with Crimes of the Mind teases. Once again the Dude is not brought, but Page’s dad is, for the encore.

7/28/93: 1st WON’T YOU COME HOME, BILL BAILEY. Dr. Jack in fine form. #drjackfreaksunite

7/28/93 verdict: Another ho-hum July show, with OK jams in the usual places. C’mon August, get here already.
