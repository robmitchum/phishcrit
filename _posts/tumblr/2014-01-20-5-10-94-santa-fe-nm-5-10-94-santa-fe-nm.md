  5/10/94 - SANTA FE, NM
  5/10/94, Santa Fe, NM, Paolo Soleri Amphitheater. Wow, what a cool venue: http://architectcs.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/psa_bowl3.jpeg
  5/10/94: Bummer, the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater was closed in 2010, according to wiki. Only held 650 people!
  5/10/94: Old-school audience capacity, old-school opening — Buried Alive > Poor Heart. Then, er, Sample.
  5/10/94: tbh, much more interested in Paolo Soleri and his crazy experimental town Arcosanti than this show so far: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcosanti
  5/10/94: Pretty fiery end to this Divided Sky, which must have been quite the experience in that venue at (presumably) sunset.
  5/10/94: Back-to-back It’s Ices like it’s on Hoist. Nice Landlady-ish Latin jazz segment bubbles up in the breakdown.
  5/10/94: Savage Melt, somewhat Stash-like. Trey grinding out discomforting riffs then unleashing feedback roars. Creative stop-start end.
  5/10/94: Another noisy anti-solo for Trey in Maze, full of the new droney tricks and treats I talk about in the next @hfpod. #plug
  5/10/94: Hey, fans in Santa Fe are doing the Wilson chant less than a month after its birth at the Beacon Theatre!
  5/10/94: Gentle, flowing Reba, starts in near silence and allowed to bloom. Audience member asks “Is that off the new album?”
  5/10/94: Real sloppy Mule, but the band plays along with Page’s solo for a bit, foreshadowing more interesting versions to come.
  5/10/94: Between Reba and this calming Hood, the Santa Fe sky and modern architecture appears to put them in a reflective mood.
  5/10/94: Given the intimate venue, a no-mics acoustic mini-set makes sense. The crowd finds Dog-Faced Boy really funny for some reason.
  5/10/94: This Bowie isn’t quite as massive/ambitious as the one I discussed with @hfpod…less decisive, much smaller peak.
  5/10/94: A mellow show closes, appropriately enough, with a Coil and a very long Page solo.

  5/10/94 Final: A fiery first set gives way to a meditative second as the soothing new age desertscape design of the venue takes control.
