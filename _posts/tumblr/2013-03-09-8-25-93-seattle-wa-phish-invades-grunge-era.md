  8/25/93 – SEATTLE, WA
  Phish invades grunge-era Seattle for 8/25/93, Seattle, WA, Paramount Theater. As seen in Nirvana and Soundgarden live releases.
  8/25/93: Immediate weirdness - minute-long atypical intro to AC/DC Bag led by some chunky piano and guitar scratches.
  8/25/93: Some more of the burpy Mike bass heard in the last show. I wonder if he just bought the flanger pedal he’ll use on DWD?
  8/25/93: The Bag is bookended with an unusual outro too, allowing for as graceful a segue into Daniel as possible.
  8/25/93: Trey banter in Daniel: “We’ve only got two gigs left on the tour after this, so we’re going to kick ass tonight. Thanks.”
  8/25/93: Though after the “kick ass” promise, they segued into Sample. So, grain of salt.
  8/25/93: Silent jams are becoming a regular part of Foam, joining Big Ball Jam in the Dept. of Doesn’t Translate Well to Tape.
  8/25/93: Oh, the silent jam was a test to see if the crowd was well-behaved enough for an unamplified mini-set. Kinda cool.
  8/25/93: Whoever recorded this AUD did a great job on the acoustic numbers. Sounds great, despite the dummy yelling “SMOKE WEED”.
  8/25/93: Trey between Nellie Kane and Sweet Adeline: “we’re going to do one with no instruments, and the next one with no people.”
  8/25/93: Stash jam begins in “annoying ringtone” mode, Mike pushes for more melody, several ideas tried within standard Stash boundaries.
  8/25/93: Every time they don’t open Set II with 2001 on this tour, I imagine that they’re mad at Kuroda for something.
  8/25/93: With Possum, Mound, and now MFMF, this show blew right past the usual early second set jam slot. A playful Possum, but still.
  8/25/93: They are on a big-time bluegrass binge. Paul & Silas makes it two shows in a row with 3 songs from the genre.
  8/25/93: Little bit of a “Freebird”-esque vocal jam in the middle of Paul & Silas.
  8/25/93: YEM jam finds its footing with a hard-rock riff and Mike making weird scratchy noises with (what I think is) his new pedal.
  8/25/93: Oh boy, Baby Gramps has shown up in the vocal jam and he’s throat-singing. Never really understood Baby Gramps.
  8/25/93: And the debut of Gramps’ Mice and Bats (http://bit.ly/10xozax ) which sounds very Tom Waits, even (especially?) with added vacuum.
  8/25/93: After Baby Gramps, we get Coil and 2 classic rock covers (GTBT, Axis). The jams are already packed up and on their way to Portland.
  8/25/93: Oh yeah…Seattle, Hendrix, duh.
  8/25/93 verdict: As the tour nears its end, the needle is swinging back from improv to hijinks. Fun, but less repeat listen value.
