  5/17/94 - SANTA BARBARA, CA
  A show for the snow - 5/17/94, Santa Barbara, CA, Arlington Theatre. Only a 90 mile trip from last night’s show, not bad.
  5/17/94: The Arlington looks pretty sweet. Has the same soundstage Spanish village decor as the Aragon in Chicago: http://sbtos.com/IMG_8959_HDR_11x18_Tom%20Ginn_ps2_sm.jpg …
  5/17/94: A rare Suzy opener, and then a watery Maze. Trey unusually sparse during a lengthy Page segment — stylistic choice or tech issues?
  5/17/94: Very abstract Trey segment finds its way into a menacing Trey/Mike rendition of Happy Birthday to You. Good Maze.
  5/17/94: More strangeness nibbling around the edges early — Mike holds “the bitter blue” line for extra measures in Mound.
  5/17/94: If I Could is getting out of the awkward new-song phase and making me feel feelings. Great solo and full band build.
  5/17/94: Pre-duel Mule jams aren’t too far off from It’s Ice breakdowns. A modernist Page solo with unsettling accompaniment.
  5/17/94: Trey announces that Fish will do an “emotion solo” during Dog-Faced Boy. Emotion solo last time played 4/25. http://rob-mitchum.tumblr.com/post/68070144435/4-25-94-knoxville-tn-time-to-give-2013-a-rest …
  5/17/94: Climbing dissonance in the Melt jam, like vines crawling up a graveyard wall. Horrific modulation of the chords at the end.
  5/17/94: Awww, the crowd sings Happy Birthday to Page during the (short) Coil solo. Guess that solves the Maze mystery.
  5/17/94: Nice effects-driven Trey playing in the second-set Jim opener. Helicopter wah, and some more Maze/Melt-style noise.
  5/17/94: First Tweezer since the Bomb Factory. *puts on helmet* *straps on safety belt*
  5/17/94: Trey starts to chop up the Tweezer rhythm, but Fish keeps it rooted. Hard rock riff becomes the 1st & only “Earache My Eye.”
  5/17/94: I like the hushed extra-percussive return to the Tweezer riff after Earache. Back to the old slowdown ending, with a blues chaser.
  5/17/94: “Earache My Eye” is a lot like Fuck Your Face, isn’t it?
  5/17/94: Peeked at the song history chart on @phishnet, and this is the first of SEVEN consecutive Tweezers that land in Lifeboy.
  5/17/94: First Big Ball Jam in 16 shows. I did not miss it.
  5/17/94: Fish says he broke his bass drum during Sample, and his vacuum is “on its last legs.” A marathon tour takes its toll.
  5/17/94: Straightforward Slave to end the set, and one last birthday wish for Page from Trey. Is Highway to Hell a message about turning 31?
  5/17/94 Final: Tweezer’s return couldn’t help but disappoint, but Trey’s new noisy approach is all over this show, esp Maze, Jim.

  5/17/94 postcript: @shapsio says they brought out a cake for Page during the Coil solo. Last On-Stage Cake until 12/31/13?
