  5/7/94 - DALLAS, TX
  Strap in for 5/7/94, Dallas, TX, The Bomb Factory. Brought to you in crystal-clear SBD quality by Live Phish Vol. 18.
  5/7/94: Little known fact — this show has a first set too! And it prophetically kicks off with a Llama ft. some subtle DDL trickery.
  5/7/94: Another early sign something is in the air: a (rather lumbering, tbh) Horn gets a little improvised Trey/Mike postscript.
  5/7/94: More DDL in DivSky. It really wasn’t used much after Trey hurt his ankle, so it seems like he rediscovered it just before this show.
  5/7/94: It is hard, after all, to operate guitar pedals when you’re on crutches.
  5/7/94: The SBD mix strangely makes this show sound larger/better-attended than others on the southern swing. Capacity: 2700.
  5/7/94: Phish pranks the setlist abbreviators by playing both SOAMs back-to-back for the first time.
  5/7/94: Melt jam is no less raucous than usual, but slower developing. Mike in more of a leadership role, unless it’s just the pro SBD mix.
  5/7/94: RT @dunhamrc: Gwar was playing either next door or at the same venue day before or after, can’t remember which.
  5/7/94: Quiet segment around 12:00 in Melt built around creepy variant of the 3-note return and ominous piano chords.
  5/7/94: Between Mule, If I Could, and Suzy, a real Page piano spotlight to close out the first set.
  5/7/94: Strange how Loving Cup flipped from being a set opener to a closer over its tenure in the Phish songbook.
  5/7/94: A pretty innocuous, halting slip into Tweezer, with some chatter between the verses. I wonder if this will be a good version?
  5/7/94: Other than Fish’s repeated “Whut?,” the first 9-1/2 minutes are pretty standard clockwork discord 93/early-94 Tweezer.
  5/7/94: But around 10:00, when they almost ease into the standard slowdown ending, but instead lock onto a funky Mike line…
  5/7/94: Into a violent cartoon chase segment, and by the time they reach the blues strut ~14:00 they’re well off orbit and unconcerned.
  5/7/94: Blues jam is another potential exit, but Fish fires up the tempo to Buried Alive/Llama levels. Some pairing off brings the weird.
  5/7/94: When they all get back in line for a deep-wah, stop-start groove, they blow past the 20-minute mark…the first Tweezer to do so.
  5/7/94: Trey almost returns to the Tweezer riff at 22:30, but instead finds a great MLB-ish pattern (or maybe 12/30/93 Mikes-ish) to peak.
  5/7/94: Another fake slowdown, then Mike thinks “We haven’t gotten this experimental since Aug 93” and so triggers SPARKS in tribute.
  5/7/94: The digital delay loop jam is so great. “Check out my new toy” self-indulgence transforms into a rich, new sound in 4 minutes flat.
  5/7/94: As big a step forward as this Tweezer is improv-wise, they still can’t help falling back on the classic rock teasefest crutch.
  5/7/94: The Sweet Emotion jam and Walk Away are like a little crowd-friendly cover band oasis in the deep jamming desert.
  5/7/94: The stretch pre-Cannonball is definitely where they weren’t sure what to do, but they DON’T STOP, which is the important part.
  5/7/94: Oh, Cannonball jam, you are the sloppy, giddy best.
  5/7/94: Forgot/blocked out Trey yelling “SUCK IT!!!” at Fish during the Purple Rain solo.
  5/7/94: A band in-joke transforming into a triumphant, emotional moment before our eyes…yeah, the HYHU jam pretty much sums up this show.
  5/7/94: Sample encore, or Let’s Not Get Too Far Ahead of Ourselves. I like to imagine an Elektra rep on tour w/ them, frowning thru Set II.
  5/7/94 Final: In The Phish Book, Page pegs this show as the point where they start playing extended jams. Maybe so, maybe not…
  …Either way, it’s a big step forward from 93 “teasefests,” because for the first 20-some minutes (and for a few segments after)…
  …they’re in true free territory, not teasing their own work or well-known hits. It doesn’t always click here…
  …but just finding the courage to try (and not getting booed off the stage, even in TX) sets the stage for the rest of the year/era. 
  BONUS CONTENT: This is the Page quote from The Phish Book: “Once in Dallas [5/7/94] we decided to play ‘Tweezer’ for the whole set, which was probably the beginning of our whole extended-song thing.”
