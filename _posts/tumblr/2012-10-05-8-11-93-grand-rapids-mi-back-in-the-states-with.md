8/11/93 - GRAND RAPIDS, MI
Back in the States with 8/11/93, Grand Rapids, MI, Eastbrook Theatre. An August 93 show I know nothing about.
8/11/93: Tonight’s immediate sign that interesting things are afoot is an atypical Jim with Mike leading the way through some hyper-funk.
8/11/93: Why weigh on a sunny day in Chicago? (Because I’m cooking)
8/11/93: Another extended Page solo in the middle of It’s Ice. Happy that they’re doing something with that section.
8/11/93: Here’s the debut of Ginseng, with a semi-acoustic setup (Trey acoustic, Fish washboard). A preview of Rev. Jeff apprenticeship?
8/11/93: “That’s the first time we’ve played that song…We’ve never played this song before either,” Trey lies as he starts MFMF.
8/11/93: Very long MFMF outro, with stop-start spookiness and added vocal jam pre-Myfe. So strange, so good.
8/11/93: Stash back to old tricks until Trey & Mike lock into a thundering, slow Sabbath-esque lick around 8:00 that drones to a whisper.
8/11/93: Behind the curtain: I’m making chicken tikka masala and sauce was boiling as that Stash peaked and it was pretty intense I tell ya.
8/11/93: They started so many sets this summer w/ short instrumental ditties that it’s weird to launch right into Mike’s to open Set II.
8/11/93: New four-note riff stitched into the usual Mike’s 1st jam progression, giving it a Melt-like feel, before taking over second jam.
8/11/93: 2nd consecutive Mike’s to go deeply abstract; this one almost flirts with the Simple riff as it changes speeds up and down.
8/11/93: Using Great Gig as the sandwich meat in this Mike’ Groove gets the Fish song out of the way early. I approve.
8/11/93: By coincidence, during this Great Gig I’m cutting the tag off the Dark Side of the Moon shirt I bought for my baby. #progdad
8/11/93: Weekapaug returns after being forgotten on 8/7. Opens up quickly into 94-style ADD jamming: crazy rhythms, shape-shifting themes.
8/11/93: The transition back from abstract wilderness into the Weekapaug theme was pretty great. Patient and unique.
8/11/93: After that 30-min slab of Mike’s Groove, they’ve walked it back to more “accessible” fare w/ Esther, ATR, Bouncin, Rift.
8/11/93: First Jesus Just Left Chicago of the summer. Page actually sang the “just,” which I don’t believe I’ve heard him do before.
8/11/93: Simpsons themes everywhere - multiple secret language cues in MSO, teased in Antelope jam.
8/11/93 verdict: Mike’s Groove is the centerpiece, maybe the moment the band began molting for the more challenging improv of 94.
