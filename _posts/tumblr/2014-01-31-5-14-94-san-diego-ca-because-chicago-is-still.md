  5/14/94 - SAN DIEGO, CA
  Because Chicago is still frozen in, I will once again escape to 1994 and the West Coast with 5/14/94, San Diego, CA, Montezuma Hall.
  5/14/94: Continuing a string of unusual venues, Montezuma Hall appears to just be a big room in the SDSU student union.
  5/14/94: Curiously, after it turned up in Santa Fe on 5/10, the Wilson chant has not made it to San Diego. Secret language instead.
  5/14/94: Worth noting that this show marks the end of the first of THREE cross-country trips they will make in 1994. VT to CA in six weeks.
  5/14/94: Some brief, improv curios in Wilson and Fee carrying the load so far. Harmonic Fee outro too short as (almost) always.
  5/14/94: An easygoing, Southern California kind of Reba. Good pace set by Fish, purposeful melodic weaving by the others.
  5/14/94: Perhaps it’s the room, perhaps it’s the SBD mix, but Fishman sounds unusually strident in this show, esp on DWD/Sample.
  5/14/94: The battle of the laughers vs. the shushers is resumed over a no-mics Ginseng in the now standard acoustic format.
  5/14/94: “A little song about our muddy Mississippi delta Vermont home,” says Trey. “The northernmost part of the Mississippi River.”
  5/14/94: After some exploratory versions, this Bowie gets right down to business around 6:00 with a unison, descending three-note theme.
  5/14/94: Fish muscles up on the tempo, so Trey decides to go full car alarm drone before bringing Bowie home. No ADD excursions this time.
  5/14/94: Following my recent accusations of second set flowlessness, Phish responds with a Curtain opener > a plucky Mike’s. Well played.
  5/14/94: Mike’s second jam gets into some seasick space with circular, out-of-phase patterns. Gently DDL-infused Hydrogen follows.
  5/14/94: Weekapaug returns after a long 11-show vacation…the most recent Mike’s was ungrooved. Propulsive, with a nice detour into DivSky.
  5/14/94: That DivSky tease and its delicate coda gave way to TMWSIY, which is almost silent in its reprise, a tranquil lullaby.
  5/14/94: The band tries to shake itself awake with PYITE. Unusual intro to this one before Trey counts the drums in.
  5/14/94: There have been a lot of hints of Landlady in jams lately (esp Ice), and they effortlessly zoom through it within PYITE.
  5/14/94: FEFY and Lizards and you can quite rightly call this set *mellow*. Trey really tore into a brief FEFY solo though.
  5/14/94: I know this is a SBD, but in the quiet moments (such as Page’s Lizards solo) it almost sounds like they are playing an empty room.
  5/14/94: As my wife would say, Page is really *selling it* on this “Bold As Love.” As always, it’s adorable.
  5/14/94 Final: The first set seemed a little too “direct,” but the second set was weird, pretty cohesive, and so chill. Stay frosty.
