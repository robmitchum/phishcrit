  12/29/93 – NEW HAVEN, CT
  Show some love for 12/29/93, New Haven, CT, New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 1st show at the venue, capacity 11,171.
  12/29/93: Pretty ragged Jim opener, with technical problems knocking out Trey’s guitar for a good chunk of the jam.
  12/29/93: The couple minutes of no-guitar Phish trio was pretty cool though…maybe it inspired Trey to buy his percussion kit.
  12/29/93: Already a repeat in the run, but it’s Peaches, so I’ll allow it. Is this the last NYE run before the no-repeats rule?
  12/29/93: Peaches got between the traditional Jim > Foam pairing - not a cool move on V-Day, dude. As revenge, Foam was a slopfest.
  12/29/93: Hoo boy, Glide and Divided have also had their SLOP ALARM moments. Maybe the band is distracted by all the aquatic props.
  12/29/93: Feel like I should say something nice about this show, so…the Divided jam was pretty energetic.
  12/29/93: Still no Wilson chanting, very strange to hear in such a big room. Instead, creepy snorts and hiccups from somebody in the band.
  12/29/93: A couple brief, weird interludes in Wilson; one sounded more like an It’s Ice breakdown. Things were better pre-chant.
  12/29/93: Stash threatens to go over the cliff, but everyone hits the peak at different times, and Trey shouts out Connie Chung. #nineties
  12/29/93: The band leaves the stage pretty quickly in Coil leaving Page for a longer than usual solo for the era. Doesn’t add up to much.
  12/29/93: Really like Maze as a second set opener. Let’s see if it can ignite this show.
  12/29/93: Decent Maze, but then Bouncin’ and Fluffhead and zzzzz.
  12/29/93: Antelope jam takes a detour, but it’s merely a couple minutes of quiet micro-jamming before jumping back into the climb.
  12/29/93: No time to run the statistical analysis, but it seems like Contact and BBFCFM show up together a lot, right? Weird pairing.
  12/29/93: Haha, Fish slows down the drumbeat to about quarter-speed in one of the BBFCFM freakouts and it’s super disorienting.
  12/29/93: …and sets up an excellent segue into Walk Away. The first unexpected thrill of the show.
  12/29/93: Kind of amazed they’d risk the Big Ball Jam in an 11,000-person arena. What if they never got the balls back? Would it never end?
  12/29/93: Before his segment, Fishman tells an extended story about his new haircut, done by “Victor of Paris on Sunset Boulevard.”
  12/29/93: When the band’s not feeling it, the gimmicks come to the fore. So we get BBJ, “If I Only Had a Brain”, acapella, and a cursory CDT
  12/29/93: First electric Nellie Kane in a while, at least since they decided to introduce an acoustic setup halfway through summer.
  12/29/93 verdict: Well, that was a dud. Are there actually more ho-hum 12/29 shows than great ones? Is it arena fright? Stay tuned.
