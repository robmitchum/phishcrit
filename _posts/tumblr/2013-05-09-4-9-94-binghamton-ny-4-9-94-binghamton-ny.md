  4/9/94 - BINGHAMTON, NY
  4/9/94, Binghamton, NY, Broome County Arena. Home of the Binghamton Senators, holds nearly 7k. Taxiing around the Northeast.
  4/9/94: A Magilla opener is a curious thing. They must want to keep it fresh between horns shows. Retains some New Orleans shuffle from 4/4.
  RT @neddyo: @phishcrit that was me in the front row calling for a Wilson opener… had to settle for 2nd song, band determined to play some arena jazz
  4/9/94: Light on jams so far — Wilson was a shredfest — but not wasting any time between songs. First Gin of the year up now.
  4/9/94: No sign of Murat mania in this Gin. Bumps against its boundaries, lands in some repetitive lurching that peters out into Nellie.
  4/9/94: Trying to think of what song’s slot Julius has stolen, but drawing a blank. Nothing prior to 94 was such straightforward blues-rock.
  4/9/94: However, a very pleasant segue from Fee’s harmonic outro into All Things Reconsidered is a good palate cleanser of weird/prog.
  4/9/94 Sounded like a pure lights cheer as the Stash jam starts to lift-off. Back to long, aggressive tension builds and illusory peaks.
  4/9/94: The other three appear to be clearing out faster for Coil, and Page is taking his solo farther from home. One to watch this year.
  4/9/94: Yeah yeah, Sample as second set opener, but it means five different Set II leadoffs in five shows. Relief after summer’s 2001-fest.
  4/9/94: For some reason, this is the first show where the juxtaposition between songs like Sample and Reba feels very jarring. Transitions.
  4/9/94: Maybe it’s the source, but Trey’s been using some unusually fuzzy tone, first in Coil, now in an otherwise competent Reba.
  4/9/94: …and the set just got weird. Vocal-aided outro to Peaches morphs into instrumental Little Drummer Boy, which gets Big Ball Jammed.
  4/9/94: The debut of Demand is as awkward as it always will be live. Crowd greets it quietly…did they not get to the end of Hoist yet?
  4/9/94: Trey using that dirty tone and his DDL to trigger some spring-loaded noisy squalls in the first jam of this Mike’s - cool trick.
  4/9/94: Looks like Lifeboy failed its audition, as Hydrogen returns for a Mike’s Groove Classique.
  4/9/94: Little Drummer Boy returns in Weekapaug, making this a true LDBfest. Funny how little can change in ~20 years.
  4/9/94: Divided Sky teases and then a surfy section that becomes a very rhythmic DEG briefly. Lots packed into this ‘Paug.
  4/9/94: Unexpected vocal jam to close out Weekapaug, with Trey using his DDL like one of those sound effect keychains (or maybe it is one).
  4/9/94: Tela and Slave arrive to chill out this set. The former hasn’t been seen in 22 shows, but the latter gets all the crowd love.
  4/9/94: Ahh, the Amazing Grace and Highway to Hell pairing, or “The Theological Encore”. Last seen 5/3/93.
  4/9/94: “Highway to Hell was jokingly dedicated to some fans in the front row, who were chanting for AC/DC Bag, and not an AC/DC song.”
  4/9/94 Final: Not a show that totally hangs together, but some solid improv here and there. Still working to mesh the new with the old.
