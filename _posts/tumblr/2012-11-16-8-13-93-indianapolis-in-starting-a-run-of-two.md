  8/13/93 - INDIANAPOLIS, IN
  Starting a run of two officially released shows w/ 8/13/93, Indianapolis, IN, Murat Theatre. Thanks for the SBD on this one,@shapsio.
  8/13/93: First, the soundcheck, wherein Fishman shows off his creepily accurate Jim Morrison impression on Love Me Two Times.
  8/13/93: If you like conversations about whether the washboard is too loud in the mix, this soundcheck is a MUST-LISTEN.
  8/13/93: Mike to Page after Ginseng soundcheck: “Nice piano playing in there, it sounds really good.” #teambuilding
  8/13/93: And the show proper starts with the 3rd Lengthwise opener of the year, though maybe the only one with music behind it? Neat.
  8/13/93: Every August show seems to start with weirdness, and tonight it’s a Llama with a short, sparse breakdown and a surprise Makisupa.
  8/13/93: Weird stereo-panning sound effects in this extra-dubby Makisupa sound great on the SBD. Wonder if it was even noticeable live.
  8/13/93: Trey’s ambient drone bleeding over from the end of Makisupa to the start of Foam is <kisses fingers>.
  8/13/93: The subtitle of this Foam is “Experiments in Volume”.
  8/13/93: Stash jam less concerned with tension/release than tension/tensioner. Haunted arcade noises, Middle Eastern basslines, splashes.
  8/13/93: @bizarchive alert! Trey teases the “Wurm” part of “Starship Trooper” on the acoustic at the end of Stash, 11:54 on the SBD.
  8/13/93: I don’t know why “Mr. Butt With Protruding Arms and Legs” didn’t catch on as a recurring Fish nickname.
  8/13/93: Little extra pep at the end of Fluffhead, with a particuarly fiery Trey solo and an extended cooldown.
  8/13/93: Nearly five minutes of Bowie intro with My Favorite Things tease, harmonics duel, and general spookiness. Happy belated Halloween.
  8/13/93: This Bowie jam can’t decide if it wants to be scary or surf-rock. So it’s both. And that’s kind of awesome.
  8/13/93: That Bowie was a heavy meal, all over the place (including Mango and Magilla) in 20 minutes. Interesting contrast w/ the Gin.
  8/13/93: Strapping in for the Murat Gin.
  8/13/93: Worth noting again that this Gin is only the 6th of the year. Strange that a watershed moment would happen in a rarely played tune.
  8/13/93: Beauty of the Murat Gin is that it combines two ‘93 improv advances, the 2/20 Mike’s teasefest and the 4/21 Melt full-band peak…
  8/13/93: …while also pointing the way forward to ‘94 with its segmented, ADD style of quickly exploring multiple themes and switching.
  8/13/93: It’s kind of an abstract of what the band learned to do over the course of 1993, boiled down to 15 minutes.
  8/13/93: …with a lot of Fish babble over the top.
  8/13/93: Post-Gin, the band is totally slap-happy. Dig the “Leo! Help me!” in Ya Mar, and megaphone Trey backing vox for Mike’s.
  RT @YEMblog @phishcrit #phish Rule #3,982: When Trey starts spouting shit during the intro to Mike’s good things happen
  8/13/93: Lifeboy is a really odd choice in the middle of this bonkers set, but I guess everyone needed a deep breath/bathroom break.
  8/13/93: For the second time in a week (8/7, prev), the band fails to formally close out a Mike’s Groove. Unless you count the Gin teases.
  8/13/93: Really like the Page “solo” in this Suzy, minimalist but fast, with Trey funk comps around the edges.
  8/13/93: Something nicely symmetrical about playing Lifeboy and Highway to Hell in the same show.
  8/13/93 verdict: Bowie and Gin are another step forward, but the whole show is loose, creative, and packed full of detail. Exhausting!
