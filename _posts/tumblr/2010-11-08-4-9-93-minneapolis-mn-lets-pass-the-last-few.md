4/9/93 - MINNEAPOLIS, MN
Let’s pass the last few pre-vacation (and pre-Chucktown) hours with #phish project show 45: 4/9/93, Minneapolis, MN, State Theatre.
4/9/93: SOUNDCHECK BONUS - Crazy Stones/Talking Heads medley/mashup, highlighted by Psycho Killer riff over Miss You bass.
4/9/93: After an unusual 3 days off, the band still sounds pretty crisp to start out the show proper. A frisky Chalkdust opener.
4/9/93: Well-rested isn’t always good; the band briskly gallops through Stash w/o taking it deep, despite an unusually dirty Trey tone.
4/9/93: Good to be back in SBD after a long run of AUDs. Page’s Leslie speaker giving me headphone vertigo on this “Maze.”
4/9/93: Buried Alive and All Things Reconsidered sandwich around Suzy. Just need Oh Kee Pa to complete the quirky instrumental trifecta.
4/9/93: Mike is just merrily bopping away on the “Groove is in the Heart” bassline in the background of this YEM.
4/9/93: I love when Brad Sands gets an intro during a Fish song. Most famous stage manager ever?
4/9/93: Worth mentioning the frequent references to a “Mr. Cookie Head” throughout this set. Audience member in a costume, sez @phishnet.
4/9/93 verdict: Soundcheck jam might have set the bar too high, not much to remember here. See you in Charleston tomorrow for my 40th show!
