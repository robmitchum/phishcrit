  8/12/93 - ROCHESTER HILLS, MI
  Finally ready to dive back into Aug ‘93 with 8/12/93, Rochester Hills, MI, Meadow Brook Music Festival. No hurricanes in the forecast.
  8/12/93: …and it’s already weird. Trey and Mike trade a riff (maybe a tease) as an impromptu AC/DC Bag intro.
  8/12/93: A straightforward Bag jam ends in an unusual, jazzy place, before triggering an unusually early Reba. Good ol’ unpredictable 8/93.
  8/12/93: Atypical Reba that is weirdly Stash-like, tense but pretty. Instead of peaking, hits thorny section w/ proto-Storage Trey drones.
  8/12/93: Just the faintest hint of CYHMK in Chalkdust and key change silliness in the Guelah intro to keep things interesting.
  8/12/93: Whole lotta notes in this SOAMelt, gets spookier/better when they ease off the gas for the last few minutes.
  8/12/93: Ha, Trey plays one time through the Melt jam theme on acoustic before starting The Horse.
  8/12/93: Poor Heart is a good time to register that returning to Aug 93 after a couple months of mostly 3.0 makes them sound CRAZY fast.
  8/12/93: A solid 3.5 minutes of full-band jamming in Coil before the band yields the floor to Page. Pretty chill.
  8/12/93: Psyched to see 2001 finally creep past the 5-minute mark, but turns out it’s due to some awkward guitar technical difficulties.
  8/12/93: If that 2001 > Landlady was a gymnastics dismount, it would have been a faceplant.
  attack style and soft reggae noodle. Umphreys-ish.
  8/12/93: The Lizards, The Landlady, The Sloth — is this The “The” Show?
  8/12/93: I think the mystery riff from the very start of the show might have just turned up again in the Trey section of Maze.
  8/12/93: The crowd is really eating up this Page scat in Lawn Boy.#um
  8/12/93: I guess they used up all the secret language earlier in the show, so this lurking Possum features Tweezer teases instead.
  8/12/93 verdict: Some front-loaded fun, especially in the unusual Reba, but the rest is routine (and sloppy) by Aug 93 standards.
