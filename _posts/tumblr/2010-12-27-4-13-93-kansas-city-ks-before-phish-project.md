4/13/93 - KANSAS CITY, KS
Before #phish project show 48 (4/13/93, Kansas City, KS, Memorial Hall), enjoy @marcusgilmer on why Phish are must-see: http://bit.ly/fOI78l
4/13/93: As pointed out on @GuyForgetOPT''s #fall97 project (#ff), Foam has been the 2nd song of a show over 100 times. As it is here.
4/13/93: Bit of a letdown that a shredfest Possum is the only significant jam of this set, but crowd sounds chatty and distracted.
4/13/93: Woah big #phish rarity: Trey has to tune his guitar in the middle of Forbin’s. Almost never happens.
4/13/93: Forbin narration starts with Terry, the band’s truck driver, towing venue to Gamehendge while listening to MC 900 Ft Jesus. #the90s
4/13/93: To be more exact, the venue is dropped off the world’s largest ski jump into Gamehendge, while Page teases “Jump” on piano. #the80s
4/13/93: Was excited for a Guelah into Caravan segue, but @phishnet LIES. Now just excited to hear Caravan again. (3rd Duke in 5 shows)
4/13/93: Caravan then Cavern. Let’s have a toast to the dyslexics.
4/13/93: Jam-free zone continues into second set: MFMF, Rift, Sloth, Uncle Pen. What’s the matter with Kansas?
4/13/93: What’s this? A jam? Mike’s flirts with “Walk This Way,” gets into an interesting melodic segment between peaks instead of > H2
4/13/93: Apparently only Mike’s OR Weekapaug can be a show highlight - latter is pretty standard until “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” ending.
4/13/93: Band sticks around for longer than usual on Coil outro, Trey does some proto-digiloop stuff. Routinely pretty Page solo follows.
4/13/93 verdict: Other than a couple solid minutes in Mike’s, this show is a run up the middle, jam-wise. A safe show for a tough room.
