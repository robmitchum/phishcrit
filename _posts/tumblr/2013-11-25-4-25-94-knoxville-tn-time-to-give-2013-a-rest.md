  4/25/94 - KNOXVILLE, TN
  Time to give 2013 a rest and get back to 1994. 4/25/94, Knoxville, TN, Civic Auditorium. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-25 …
  4/25/94: What better sign of being in the past than a Landlady opener - the first since July 93 and the first GCH-less version of 94.
  4/25/94: Nice taste of ambient Trey over the Jim breakdown, and an extra, embarrassing “woahhhh” from somebody when they come back.
  4/25/94: Forcefully tidal Jim jam, with some of those car alarm/slide whistle Trey loops layered into his note flurry.
  4/25/94: This installment of the Frustratingly Short Fee Jam is reggae-tinged, and it sets up a pretty rad, true segue into Foam.
  4/25/94: Instead of the silent jam, Trey’s Foam solo diverts into a four-way weird noise competition, similar to an Antelope intro.
  4/25/94: Mike and Fish menacingly growl “Write it Down!” in the Disease intro, no explanation. Lots of little oddities in this show.
  4/25/94: Not sure…does anyone know when Trey’s cast came off? RT @takesunset: @phishcrit is that one of the “broken ankle” shows?
  4/25/94: Hard/dangerous to hear Trey’s no-mics banter, but apparently someone is doing an “emotion solo” during Dog-Faced Boy.
  4/25/94: Clarification: It was Fish/“Greasy Fizeek” on emotion solo, of course.
  4/25/94: Melt starts out jazzy, then jams over a twisted version of the “Under Pressure” riff (turns on @bizarchive signal).
  4/25/94: Melt gets kind of messy in the back half. Growing pains as they experiment with a new approach to the jam?
  4/25/94: Again with the Curtain > Sample. I thought we talked about this, guys.
  4/25/94: Hey MMGAMOIO made it into 1994, giving me the chance to type out my favorite Phish acronym.
  4/25/94: Trey, Page and Mike trade some fun, subtle teases of the “Layla” riff in the Antelope intro, keeps going into the 2nd segment.
  4/25/94: One of those Antelope jams where they don’t so much stick the landing as shatter both femurs upon impact.
  4/25/94: Nice Page solo in Coil, but right in the middle of the set? Then Divided Sky, to continue the setlist shuffle.
  4/25/94: This is the first second set Divided Sky of my entire project, by the way.
  4/25/94: Speaking of acronyms, how about a BBJ > BBFCFM pairing? What a strange grab-bag of a setlist.
  4/25/94: Ha, Phishtracks faded out BBFCFM early, and I thought they were doing Amazing Grace during the BBFCFM pause. Good idea!

  4/25/94 Final: A quirky show, but with minuscule jamming and a very illogical setlist. Sixth show in six nights — take a break, Phish.
