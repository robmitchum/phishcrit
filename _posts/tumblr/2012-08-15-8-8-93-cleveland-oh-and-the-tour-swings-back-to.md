8/8/93 - CLEVELAND, OH
And the tour swings back to the Buckeye State for 8/8/93, Cleveland, OH, Nautica Stage. Even I’m getting tired w/ this schedule/route.
8/8/93: BBFCFM is certainly an energetic way to start off a show. Trey plays part of the Divided Sky ending over the breakdown.
8/8/93: Trey starts off his Foam solo with “Dixie” for some reason (at 5:02, Mr. @bizarchive). Last I checked, OH was on the Union’s side.
8/8/93: Hard to believe it’s been 50 shows since the last Loving Cup, one of the spring tour’s themes. Could probably use a break today.
8/8/93: Traditional Jim-Foam marriage continues to unravel in 8/93. This time Foam before Jim, with a Loving Cup interloper.
8/8/93: This set has gone super mellow, with a Horse > Silent and FEFY. After two torrid shows, it’s kind of nice.
8/8/93: Little extra boogie in this Paul & Silas, which has been mostly snubbed this summer in favor of Daniel as the gospel-grass go-to.
8/8/93: Ha, Fish attempting to break the world record for “the sparsest washboard solo ever in the history of mankind” in I Didn’t Know.
8/8/93: Trey doing some Pong-y stuff in the Bowie intro that would sound great with the DDL pedal. Can’t wait for that thing to show up.
8/8/93: The band chooses the “hard rock Spooky-esque” path for this Bowie jam. Great Trey lead, alternating fast arpeggios and sustain.
8/8/93: 2001 is getting a little more interesting, though it’s all in the intro. Once the drumbeat starts, it’s like a recording.
8/8/93: Hood jam spends a long time fluttering gorgeously at low volume, hits a dark patch on the way to a standard peak. Feels good.
8/8/93: Crowd behavior update - some Stash clapping (in the northeast, at least), but no Wilson chanting yet. That’s a good thing.
8/8/93: Some fuller piano work during the It’s Ice breakdown. It sure seems like they’re trying to give Page a showcase every night.
8/8/93: Fluffhead > Possum segment pretty by-the-book, other than a nice reprise of the “Tequila” teases from 8/6 in the latter.
8/8/93: Been awhile since the old Big Ball Jam/Fish song set-killing combo, at least it’s Love You and Trey was introduced as “Chuck Norris”
8/8/93: Sorry to bug @bizarchive again, but there’s a “Rock and Roll Part II” tease from Page in the first HYHU.
8/8/93: Kind of an unusual GTBT - more thematic than shreddy, if that makes any sense.
8/8/93 verdict: A refreshingly mellower show for this blistering month. Not as consistent or inventive either, but memorable Bowie, Hood versions.
