4/3/93 - VANCOUVER, BC
Getting back to #phish project, show 43: 4/3/93, Vancouver, BC, 86th Street Music Hall. 1st international show of the project!
4/3/93: Many trips and stumbles through “Rift,” showing why it is today filed under “rare because it’s too hard to play.”
4/3/93: Trey spends part of the Melt jam playing at a totally different rhythm than the rest of the band; it actually works in spots.
4/3/93: Mid-set Coil means short Page solo (2.5 min), but this one is really nice - somber and purposeful. 
4/3/93: Super confident Reba, no delicate patches, just a fluid build to peak. ‘93 Type I mastery.
4/3/93: I think Trey has used the “don’t do anything we wouldn’t do” line before setbreak in 75% of shows this tour.
4/3/93: Rare second-set Stash? Y. Very unorthodox jam at first too, w/ sudden bursts of noise, before settling back into comfort zone.
4/3/93: Wow, the little ambient jam at the start of YEM gets a nice dark expansion here. Altered Zones style, y’all.
4/3/93: This 27-min (!) YEM may be the best of the year so far; sounds like ‘95 Phish teleported back to ‘93 for a song. #scottbakula
4/3/93: The pause in this My Sweet One is FOUR MINUTES LONG. Dude in crowd yells “turn it up!”
4/3/93 verdict: I hereby give this the official “sleeper show” seal. Great, exploratory YEM and solid old-school Reba, Stash, Antelope reps.
