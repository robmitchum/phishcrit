  4/6/94: As @drewphish pointed out, @doggoneblog wrote a post about the venue’s history and this show here: http://doggoneblog.com/2010/04/06/the-toronto-rock-pile/ …
  4/6/94: Another high-energy old-school opening w/ Llama, Guelah, Poor Heart; a step down from the awesome Chalkdust > Who Knows in August.
  4/6/94: 9 minutes in, the year’s 1st Stash splinters into shards of glass, slowly reassembles. Well-coordinated “Mike’s Song” chant follows.
  4/6/94: Good Lizards in an unusual mid-first set slot; was a reliable second-setter in 93. Then the radio-friendly unit shifter in a jar.
  4/6/94: Page’s Mule solo really brings some unexpected avant-garde to the middle of Mike’s silly bluegrass song.
  4/6/94: Nice chime-like harmonic mini-jam leading out of Fee into Antelope, which adds a dash of whistling in the first section.
  4/6/94: Very linear Antelope after the long, winding August 93 versions. Just taking a few steps back to get a running start.
  4/6/94: Love The Curtain as a set opener, but the transition into Disease doesn’t really work. They only tried it one more time, in ‘96.
  4/6/94: The second Disease feels closer to its mature tempo. Trey already finding those triumphant peaks.
  4/6/94: The first horn-less Wolfman’s sounds a little lost - the band tries to replicate the horn stab-fight, but just kind of dwindles off.
  4/6/94: The crowd got the Mike’s it demanded, and it might be the weirdest jam of the young year. Slow down, then echoes of 12/30’s triumph.
  4/6/94: I know my Lifeboy dislike is unpopular, but even boosters have to admit it’s kind of a downer in a Mike’s Groove, right?
  4/6/94: They blew right past the Fish segment, though he cheerily introduces the Madonna washboard for a no-mics bluegrass encore.
  4/6/94: Not sure yet if no-mics bluegrass is more or less frustrating on tape than no-mics a cappella. Crowd is slightly more respectful.
  4/6/94 Final: They’re still getting their road legs, but Stash and Mike’s offer promise while the new songs are amusingly wobbly.
