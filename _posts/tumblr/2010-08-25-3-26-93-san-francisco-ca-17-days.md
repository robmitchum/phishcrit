3/26/93 - SAN FRANCISCO, CA
        
17 days… #phish project show 36! 3/26/93, Warfield Theatre, San Francisco, CA. Had a good Nirvana boot from the Warfield once. May 25, 2010 2:32:34 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93: ‘Tis a 2-night run at the Warfield, and the band already sounds less rushed in the opening Maze, if no less intense. May 25, 2010 2:45:57 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/26/93: Gratuitous Trey pizzicato on his Foam solo. #fancymusicterms May 25, 2010 2:55:13 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/26/93: Another Fee without the megaphone. I wonder when it was fully retired? I seem to remember hearing it in shows later than 93. May 25, 2010 3:09:47 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93: Forget what I said about sounding relaxed; this Melt is as tightly wound as a Rawlings. Chock full of notes, kind of exhausting. May 25, 2010 3:20:55 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93: Yow, Fluffhead/Divided Sky two-fer - only other time that happened was to open the Hampton ‘09 comeback show. May 25, 2010 3:38:47 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
3/26/93: Some cool things happening in Runaway Jim, which has been pretty narrow all tour. Trey stabs and trills over drum clatter. May 25, 2010 4:12:09 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/26/93: A couple distinct jam segments in Tweezer - power chord rock, dueling spirals - but still not up to the centipede versions of 94. May 25, 2010 4:33:32 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93 resumed: Straighforward YEM, w/ vocal jam based around the phrase “I never should have gone back to school.” <shrug> May 26, 2010 11:08:13 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93: You can really hear the fog machines cranking on this Great Gig in the Sky. May 26, 2010 11:23:16 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/26/93 verdict: Quietest crowd I’ve heard for a capella encore accurately reflects pretty chilled-out show without much to remember. May 26, 2010 11:37:31 AM CDT via TweetDeck
