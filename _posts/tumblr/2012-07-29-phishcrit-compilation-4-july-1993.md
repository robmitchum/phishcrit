The 1993 spring tour was a cross-country marathon that allowed the band ample time to evolve. On the way west, the sets were largely a mix of promotion for Rift and introductions to the band’s sound and lore for previously uninitiated crowds. But after the late March swing through California, the band that trekked back through the Midwest and into the Northeast in April and May was tighter, more confident, and more willing to take risks. As late-tour versions of Split Open and Melt, David Bowie, and Weekapaug Groove started to strain against the type I boundaries and setlists started to shake off convention, you could smell the giant leap forward of August 93 in the air.
But July 93 was a big step back. Maybe it was the two months off, maybe it was the unusual mix of venues, maybe it was the pressure of headlining amphitheaters (in New England, at least). But despite a batch of new covers to tinker with, the July shows are a return to the tentative, safe setlists and jamming of early spring. Blame whoever was booking the tours; it’s hard to build momentum when, in one week, there was a Baltimore date cancelled for low ticket sales, two awkward one-setters with the HORDE Fest, and Phish’s first headlining shows at Jones Beach and Great Woods. In the week after playing to five-figure crowds at those venues, Phish was back to theaters in Tennessee and, most hilariously, the Starwood Amphitheatre in Nashville…not the main stage, but the side stage over by the concession stands.
The new songs added to the catalog did freshen things up relative to the spring tour, but they also put the focus on humor and/or spectacle, and they were played at very high frequency. I imagine “2001” was mind-blowing for unsuspecting fans that summer, and the song symbolizes Kuroda’s lights stepping up to being an increasingly collaborative piece of the band’s live process. But for a chronological archeologist, eight shows in a row of 3-minute versions is a bit much. Same goes for the punchlines of “Purple Rain” and “Freebird,” and to a lesser extent, the novelty duo of “Daniel Saw The Stone” and “My Mind’s Got A Mind Of Its Own” (debuted in 92, but back in frequent rotation here). Simultaneously, the big jam vehicles of spring took a step back, with the best improv to be found mostly inside the box — “Maze,” for instance, was particularly good this month, without veering off course.
All that means if you’re looking for the secret of August 93 in the two weeks leading up to it, you’ll be disappointed. Peeking ahead at setlists, it’s apparent that some sort of switch was flipped at the same time as the calendar changed, but with a pretty standard five-night run to close July, the month definitely went out like a lamb. Perhaps it’s best seen as a baseline to compare back to, as the project goes beyond just confirming August 93’s greatness into trying to figure out why the month is considered among the best. But as an appetizer, July ‘93 is a little on the bland side.
PROGRAMMING NOTE: Since we find ourselves in August 2012, I figured I might as well at least attempt to work my way through the 93 shows on their 19th anniversary. So I’ll start with 8/2/93 on this Thursday, 8/2/12. No promises that I’ll stick to it: 19 shows in 27 days is a tough schedule to follow, and fresh new shows will start intruding upon my Phish listening time halfway through the month. But let’s see how it goes.

7/15/93 - Leprechaun
7/15/93: Here’s the real Leprechaun debut. It’s pretty, sort of a longer TMWSIY, but feels incomplete, like it was excised from an epic.
7/16/93 - 2001 > Split Open and Melt
7/16/93: The first 2001! So cute in its infant form. Literally 8 seconds between peaks. Wish I could hear the crowd reaction better.
7/16/93: 2001 lead-in gives Melt a little extra push, the band barely holds onto the merry-go-round bars through the jam (in a good way).


7/17/93 - The Oh Kee Pa Ceremony > David Bowie
7/17/93: I figured Oh Kee Pa > Bowie would be rare; yea verily, @phishnet confirms it as the only one ever. Jarring cymbal crash connects.
7/17/93: First significant jam of the show, and maybe the tour, in Bowie. A descending riff leads the band into stormy waters. Big peakin’.
7/18/93 - Run Like An Antelope
7/18/93: Then out of nowhere, a 15-min+ Antelope with “Heartbreaker” teases, one of the “Hey” jamming games (?), fireworks, “Brother” jam
RT @the_man_mulcahy: Looking forward to ur thoughts on 2nd set. Note the Three Rivers fireworks during Antelope. Thought they were for PH at the time.
7/21/93 - Maze
7/21/93: Whatever the rest of the band did during their Coil solo break produced an intense, itchy Maze. More conversing than soloing.
7/21/93: That was actually one of the best Mazes I’ve heard in ‘93. Don’t sleep on it.
7/22/93 - Possum
7/22/93: A Tweezer-laced Possum, but I’m more into the patient little melody Trey and Mike tinker with immediately after the tease.
7/23/93 - Chalkdust Torture
7/23/93: With the crazy high energy of this set post-Faht, Chalkdust and Highway to Hell are a fitting end. It’s all devil horns now.
7/23/93 addendum: From phish dot com: “Chalk Dust Torture contained teases of Crimes Of The Mind, but The Dude was never brought.”
7/24/93 - Mike’s Song > Yerushalayim Shel Zahav > Weekapaug Groove
7/24/93: Weird 2nd Mike’s jam explores some interesting Type II ground, taking a leisurely stroll before beginning a spiraling chase.
7/24/93: Yerushalayim Shel Zahav makes its second appearance, its first in a Mike’s Groove. Hey, happy Passover y’all.
7/24/93: Weekapaug regains some of its spring hijinks - slow-down and blues segments keep things wacky. But the Mike’s half was better.
7/25/93 - Tweezer
7/25/93: Real nice chord progression to start out the Tweezer jam, shades of “25 or 6 to 4.” Decent Type 1.5 sectional jamming follows.
7/27/93 - The Squirming Coil
7/27/93: Another mid-set Coil in a HORDE set. Strange given the civilian-friendly nature of these setlists. Guess jamcrowds dig piano solos.
7/28/93 - Harry Hood
7/28/93: Hoods from this era are weird - a little tentative, aimless, but charming. This one needs a little push to the peak but I dig.
7/29/93 - You Enjoy Myself
7/29/93: Heavy metal YEM! Entire band locks into repeated three-note riff, surrounded by Fish power-fills. Pops back up in vocal jam.
7/30/93 - Stash
7/30/93: Now THAT’S a Stash. Evil cartoon themes bloom into DEG-ish demented prog weaves. Several minutes of dissonant tension, no mercy.
7/31/93 - Foam
7/31/93: Oh me of little faith. An unusual Foam, with scratchy intro and stretched-out quiet jamming, brings a little novelty.
