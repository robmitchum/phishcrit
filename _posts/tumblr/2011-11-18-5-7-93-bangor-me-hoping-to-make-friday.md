5/7/93 - BANGOR, ME
Hoping to make Friday afternoon go faster w/ #phishproject show 67: 5/7/93, Bangor, ME, Bangor Auditorium. Maybe Stephen King was there.
5/7/93: This is the 13th time I’ve heard Buried Alive > Poor Heart on this tour. “Predictable setlist” complaints in 3.0 are absurd.
5/7/93: Last Melt of a tour where it became a very significant vehicle. Takes bow in style - rager jam clings by fingernails to structure.
5/7/93: I really enjoyed that Caravan, and would not be opposed to seeing some of the old jazz covers dusted off. #unlikely
5/7/93: That was some of the most off-rhythm audience clapping I’ve ever heard in the quiet section of this Lizards. Shame on you, Bangor.
5/7/93: Got called into a meeting right in the middle of the DivSky pause.
5/7/93: Trey toying with an embryonic version of the “Meatstick” melody in Antelope - another one that evolved from lick to song?
5/7/93: Second set opens with the band playing the radio hits (Rift, Bouncin’) for the media talent scouts of Bangor.
5/7/93: The little harmonic mini-jam at the end of Fee never goes on long enough, except for the few times that it did.
5/7/93: The Mission: Impossible theme was practically a permanent part of YEM in 1993. Learn some new teases, Page, sheesh.
5/7/93: YEM jam seems to settle on a blues riff before deconstructing into near-silence, building back to a sprint, Mike at the wheel.
5/7/93: Rare find - a Fish song (Great Gig) without a HYHU on either end. Slid out of YEM, faded into Hood.
5/7/93: Harpua narration imagines wrestler Ravishing Rick Rude as a lumberjack dog owner concerned about suburban sprawl, for some reason.
5/7/93: Oh nice, I love the “Jimmy was listening to ___” excuse for a tease. This time it’s “Crossroads,” though it sounds a bit off.
5/7/93: Guys, Phish is a pretty weird band - this show contains Duke Ellington, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC covers. Oh and “Amazing Grace.”
