  8/16/93 - ST. LOUIS, MO
  If you guessed the tumblr update meant that it’s time for 8/16/93, St. Louis, MO, American Theater, give yourself a gold star.
  8/16/93: Kicking off with the first Axilla in a while (15 shows), and the last original lyrics version for quite some time (94 shows).
  8/16/93: This is a rather seething Possum. Always so much better when it’s not just pedal to the floor throughout the jam.
  8/16/93: Possum jam interrupted by creepy stop-start segment, reprised for a post-song coda. Keeping the 8/93 early weirdness streak alive.
  8/16/93: A very chatty crowd doesn’t know what they’re in for with this Reba jam, which starts with quiet, abstract descending lines.
  8/16/93: Normal Reba jam abandoned quickly for something much darker and erratic. Eases back into Lizards-like melodic build.
  8/16/93: Thirteen minutes in, the normal Reba procedure is rediscovered, reinvigorated by the experimentation preceding.
  8/16/93: So I guess creepy codas are going to be this show’s “thing” — there’s another one in Reba post-whistling.
  8/16/93: Most of the crowd returns to their conversations after Reba, ignoring Trey’s unusual, pointillist Foam solo.
  8/16/93: Oddly enough, a silent jam recaptures their attention.#ComeOnSTL
  8/16/93: There’s a weird phasing effect on this AUD that is making me kind of seasick. #occupationalhazards
  8/16/93: Callbacks to both the engagement on 4/14/93 and Fish being “nothing but a butt with protruding arms and legs” in I Didn’t Know.
  RT @dunhamrc @phishcrit if i remember rightly they had the fog machine going for the silent jam in Foam, quietly rocked out: windmilling & head-banging
  8/16/93: In a pleasingly exploratory first set, this Melt is unfortunately a miss. Herky-jerk tempo, disconnected playing.
  8/16/93: Standard Coil to close the first set nonetheless gives us the rare Page “We’re taking a short break.”
  8/16/93: Two shows in a row where 2001 doesn’t open the second set! Are they getting sick of it? (A: No)
  8/16/93: Mike’s jam is exploratory but aimless. Kind of bluegrassy for a bit, with a noisy undercurrent. Barely any 2nd jam.
  8/16/93: First Faht since July is barely audible beneath the crowd noise. Are those birds cardinals, by chance?
  8/16/93: Weekapaug off to a much better start than its partner. Stop-start jamming with major drum fills > Santana jam.
  8/16/93: From proggy runs to blues jam to “I Wish” in just a few, fluid moves.
  8/16/93: Ideas starting to peter out, but the Weekapaug soldiers on. Possum tease around 11:33, then a Walls of the Cave-ish segment.
  8/16/93: Page’s avant-garde piano showcase in the middle of It’s Ice continues to elongate. This one is a burst of cacophony.
  8/16/93: Straightforward MFMF ending, closer to the modern-day variety. It’s a shame if the weird endings are on the way out.
  8/16/93: Big Ball Jam is mostly drums and piano by the end, which makes it somewhat tolerable. More than usual, at least.
  8/16/93: Take The A Train is a nice surprise in an increasingly routine set. 3rd one of the year, penultimate version ever.
  8/16/93: A few brief flashes of Type II-ness in a GTBT? Shocking but true.
  8/16/93: To go with the missing 2001s, this is the 2nd show in a row without a vacuum solo. All part of the 8/93 loosening of setlist form.
  8/16/93: Amazing Grace/Rocky Top encore, aka “Oh shit, curfew!”
  8/16/93 verdict: Maybe not as good as the same venue 4 months prior, but there was nothing like the gargantuan Reba or Weekapaug in April.
