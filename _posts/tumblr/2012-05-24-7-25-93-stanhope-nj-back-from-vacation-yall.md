7/25/93 - STANHOPE, NJ
Back from vacation, y’all. Celebrate or forget about Leg 2 Ticket Day with 7/25/93, Stanhope, NJ, Waterloo Village.
7/25/93: The first Wilson of the summer is pretty savage, until a goofy Jeopardy and Simpsons segment at the end.
7/25/93: Anybody know anything about Waterloo Village? Apparently it was once occupied by hobos: http://bit.ly/IeucOO cc @hodgman
RT @MelvinDisco @phishcrit my first show. So empty that we parked the car against the fence at the back of the lawn. Night and day from the ‘95 shitshow
7/25/93: Stash jam takes two dips into abstract tension, the second one finding a quieter dread that peaks too soon.
7/25/93: First Sloth of the summer too. Guess they decided to expand the song pool finally.
7/25/93: Donna Lee teases make for an oddly light-hearted Bowie intro. Jam tries to cancel the good vibes out with a DEG detour.
7/25/93: Eighth 2001 in a row, with a few extra feedback squeaks from Trey. First time it drops into Suzy, which is a decent fit.
7/25/93: Real nice chord progression to start out the Tweezer jam, shades of “25 or 6 to 4.” Decent Type 1.5 sectional jamming follows.
7/25/93: Then it got Horse’d, as the PT kids say.
7/25/93: Maze back to standard-good levels after a few hot versions. Some weird (accidental?) Garth Hudson-esque organ bends by Page.
7/25/93: The structure of this show feels more Spring ‘93 than Summer ‘93. Note: I may have listened to too many ‘93 shows.
7/25/93: Boo to this source fading out the end of Lizards, thank you to this source abridging Big Ball Jam to 1:16.
7/25/93: Hooray, 1st Harpua (or any story song) of the summer. Ft. upwards rain, Taxi, Famous Amos cookies, “Poster’s nutbag” (sic)
7/25/93 verdict: Another show straining against the standard boundaries, but not really finding a breach. Tweezer shows the most promise.
