7/30/93 - ANTIOCH, TN
As promised, now starting 7/30/93, Antioch, TN, The Veranda at Starwood Amphitheater. Lots of show notes on this one, always a good sign.

7/30/93: Trying to figure out what “The Veranda” was, found this description: “a stage set up in the concession area.” Sounds…intimate?

7/30/93: More oddness: “The Contact opener started before the band took the stage, as they were driven to the front in golf carts.”

7/30/93: Thank you! RT @KernelForbin: @phishcrit This was ‘the Veranda’ area http://bit.ly/K00NWu

7/30/93: Strange circumstances aside, Contact > Llama makes for a refreshingly unusual opening pair. Last Contact opener was in ‘90.

7/30/93: Is it poor form to play a Bill Monroe cover in TN? KY vs. TN, bluegrass vs. country, and all that.

7/30/93: Now THAT’S a Stash. Evil cartoon themes bloom into DEG-ish demented prog weaves. Several minutes of dissonant tension, no mercy.

7/30/93: Chalkdust strains at the reins, but doesn’t break free. Madonna washboard solo in IDK played at the request of “the blokes.”

7/30/93: Very patient build in Reba, stays in the box. The usual jam vehicles are stretching out, creeping up to 12-14 min from 10-ish.

7/30/93: For setbreak, an eyewitness report from @sidewinder13 on the unusual Contact opener:

@phishcrit they rode up to the stage on golfcarts w Mike and Trey playing wirelessly and extending the intro. Strange beginnings.

7/30/93: Forgot to mention last show that the 2001 streak was snapped at 10. It’s back here, but can’t imagine the lights translated well.

7/30/93: Trey doing a little Morello-style guitar-pick scratching at the oustet of Tweezer jam, over a nice, thick piano riff from Page.

7/30/93: Tweezer respectably progresses thru a few different segments, nothing really sticks. Nice electric > acoustic switch at the end.

7/30/93: A second mid-song electric > acoustic swap by Trey at the end of Fluffhead. Can’t remember two in one show before.

7/30/93: Not much to do with a Fluff, MFMF, Golgi sequence other than grade it on flub percentage, which would be miniscule. #phishrmetrics

7/30/93: Oh hey, just when you thought the set was ending with Coil — PSYCH — bonus Bowie. Hope it taps the same evil vein as Stash.

7/30/93: The Bowie only briefly touched Stash’s madness, but finished strong. 1 of only 2 Walk Away encores ever follows.

7/30/93 verdict: Never would guess they were on a side stage. Improv continues to bloom, with Stash the undisputed hidden gem of the show.
