5/29/93 - MONTEREY, CA
Enough Lana Del Rey, lets do 5/29/93, Monterey, CA, Laguna Seca Raceway. “From the land of Ben & Jerry, big welcome please: Phish!”
5/29/93: Behold the concentrated 90s power of Laguna Seca Daze. bit.ly/xxMwNt - Oh, to have seen 4 Non Blondes open for Phish.
5/29/93: Multi-band festival Phish in full effect with Chalkdust, Bouncin’, Rift to open. Here’s a nice picture though: panoramio.com/photo/1090345
5/29/93 correction: I tweeted out the 1994 Laguna Seca Daze poster earlier. Here’s 1993, still 90s as fuck: bit.ly/yD0iEy
5/29/93: Stash finds a minute of interlocking tension, with the band perseverating in that Day-Glo krautrock way they do so well.
5/29/93: Mid-set Coil is a weird call for an unfamiliar audience. Abridged Page solo, but good full band scribbling beforehand.
5/29/93: For no reason at all, there is an unaccompanied vacuum solo at the end of Cavern. Guess it was contractually required?
5/29/93: Vacuum > Big Ball Jam > trampolines. Really pulling out all the gimmicky stops here, guys.
5/29/93: Squeezing the early 93 structure down into one set makes for a strange flow. Mid-set YEM followed by Jim and Amazing Grace?
5/29/93: GTBT predictably gets the biggest response from the Allmans crowd. Wonder how they’d react to the 5/8/93 Jessica Bowie.
5/29/93 verdict: From the middle of the bill, the band offers a sample of their weirdness but tries not to scare anyone off. Decent Stash.
