Another new feature I’m starting is to compile an mp3 digest of each month covered by the big project, beginning with February 1993. I’ve set myself a few simple ground rules for putting these collections together, parameters that I fully expect to violate when it feels appropriate. But here are the basic guidelines.
1) One song or “suite” (i.e. Forbin’s > Mockingbird) per show.
2) No songs repeated within one month, within reason. (Already broke this one with two Stashs)
3) Try to accurately represent the tone of the month’s shows: don’t just pick all the big jam vehicles, but include some of the songier moments that reflect the rotation of the time. (For this outing, I’ve included a Suzy > Buried Alive > Poor Heart opening sequence and a Guelah with secret language instructions.)
4) Avoid the well-known Hall of Fame jams when possible. (No 2/20/93 Tweezer or Mike’s)
I was all set on using Megaupload for these comps before The Law intervened, so I’m going to use RapidShare initially. If you have any problems downloading this .rar file, contact me on twitter @phishcrit.

And the track listing with descriptive tweets from my reviews:
2/3/93 – Loving Cup
First on the #phish docket: 2/3/93 Portland Expo, Portland, ME. Page calls fans to the post on his new piano, before the first Loving Cup.
2/4/93 – Stash
2/4/93: Started to think this summer that “Stash” was one of the more consistent jams, this 12-min one shows it was already freaky in 2/93.
2/5/93 – David Bowie
2/5/93: crazy 4-min Bowie intro sounds a bit like “Everything In Its Right Place,” contains Vibration of Life, secret language.
2/6/93 – Wilson
2/6/93: Wow, Wilson was way more interesting pre-chant; quiet little spooky jam over the duh-nuh riff in the middle.
2/7/93 – Suzy Greenberg > Buried Alive > Poor Heart
2/7/93: Suzy > Buried Alive > Poor Heart, Ice. That’s the way to start an old-school show. 
2/9/93 – Esther
2/9/93: First set is pretty blah here. “Wedge” is losing its stretched-out Page intro, “Esther” has tons of secret language cues.
2/10/93 – Reba
2/10/93: great stuff from trey in this Reba jam. More rhythm-style playing at the start than he usually did back in the old days.
2/11/93 – Weekapaug Groove
2/11/93: Fantastic Trey leads on this Weekapaug. Some of it almost sounds like his controversial “whale sound” effects from this summer.
2/12/93 – The Wedge
2/12/93: I haven’t said this for a couple shows, but let’s start a petition to bring back the old, Page-heavy intro to The Wedge.
2/13/93 – Tweezer
2/13/93: This Tweezer is getting farther afield than any I’ve heard thus far in ‘93 - Page’s piano keeping Trey out of his comfort zone.
2/15/93 – Fee > Llama
2/15/93: Interesting jam out of Fee abruptly cut off by segue into Llama. Fee > Llama to close Set 2? Also an odd choice.
2/17/93 – You Enjoy Myself
2/17/93: The ambient section YEM is really strong, even this early; it’s a wonder it didn’t become a part of the improv arsenal until 98ish.
2/17/93: Teases galore in rad YEM jam: Mission Impossible from Page, Sunshine of Yr Love from everyone. Also: sneeze-based vocal jam.
2/18/93 – Mike’s Song
2/18/93: Mike’s is tease-heavy, foreshadowing 2/20 madness to come. Another One Bites the Dust and Page w/ In the Hall of the Mountain King.
2/19/93 – Ya Mar > You Can Call Me Al > Ya Mar
2/19/93: Soundcheck (d/l from bit.ly/b9YGI) features Ya Mar with different lyrics and a “You Can Call Me Al” jam. Bodes well.
2/19/93: Also, hilarious that Trey shouts for a “Leo” solo even in soundcheck.
2/20/93 – Harry Hood
2/20/93: Wow, forgot how great this Hood is…long, drippy intro & really pleasurable, patient build after the ADD insanity of earlier.
2/20/93: The way this Hood jam keeps fluttering off into silence is really beautiful, and requires some insane band communication.
2/21/93 – Good Times Bad Times > Paul & Silas > Pig in a Pen
2/21/93: And then there was the time #phish played an impromptu bluegrass version of Good Times Bad Times…very Jon Brionish.
2/21/93: Turns into bluegrass medley encore with Rev. Jeff Mosier; I like Phish bluegrass, maybe because it barely resembles real thing.
2/22/93 – Guelah Papyrus (w/ secret language)
2/22/93: Secret language instructions in “Guelah” for the first ever Phish show in Florida. How timely, given NYE in Miami next week!
2/23/93 – Run Like an Antelope
2/23/93: Trey and Mike darting around each other throughout Antelope as if they know my mix is muddy. Thanks, dudes.
2/23/93: Interesting tease in the 3rd section of Antelope, but I can’t place it because of @phishnet blackout. #ObligatorySOPAtweet
2/25/93 – Forbin > Mockingbird
2/25/93: Forbin cues a tutorial for FL crowds on Phish mythology - “I know it’s a confusing song if you don’t know what it’s about.”
2/25/93: Forbin narration has venue turned up-side down and swept away by wave to Gamehendge. Gilligan’s Island jam as background.
2/26/93 – Split Open and Melt
2/26/93: Actually this Melt is really awesome, percussive playing from Trey through the first couple min, followed by atonal runs. Best yet.
2/27/93 – Curtain > Stash
2/27/93: Momentum carries into Set 2 opening Curtain > Stash, latter of which goes dark in long, drum-less segment with Fish on the crashes.
