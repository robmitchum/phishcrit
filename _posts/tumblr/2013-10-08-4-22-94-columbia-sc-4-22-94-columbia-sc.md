  4/22/94 - COLUMBIA, SC
  4/22/94, Columbia, SC, Township Auditorium. We’re safely back in a DMB-free zone, everyone. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-22 …
  4/22/94: Missed Uncle Pen due to a Phishtracks glitch, but I’m sure it fit right in with the highly caffeinated start to this show.
  4/22/94: Nellie Kane makes it 6 of 7 songs under 5 minutes to open this show - and the exception (PYITE) is really two songs. So punk.
  4/22/94: Kind of sloppy Divided Sky increases the average song length, but maintains the raucous mood. Of course this show was a Fri night.
  4/22/94: In a set that really needed to take a deep breath, Bowie jam to the rescue. Dark themes bubbling to the surface.
  4/22/94: Trey slices through the atonal storm with a thrilling roller-coaster riff around 9min in that is quickly sucked back into the murk.
  4/22/94: Roller-coaster effect returns in the big finale, looped? What a fantastic Bowie! And at the end of such a hum-drum set…
  4/22/94: I either just realized the piano in Suzy’s verses is very Werewolves of London or Page is making a subtle allusion in this one.
  4/22/94: Julius really sticks out stylistically from other material in this era. It’s something about the walking bass, or the “swing.”
  4/22/94: Reba and Tweezer back-to-back like an apology for the song-heavy first set.
  4/22/94: Tweezer increasing in complexity before our eyes. Several themes and rhythms (& one Mancini tease) explored in rapid succession.
  4/22/94: Nice little double-time Psycho Killer right before the theme returns too.
  4/22/94: Longtime followers know Lifeboy is not my ballad of choice, but that was a good place for a cool-down, and it’s not too dreary.
  4/22/94: Unusual Jim placement bodes well, and breakdown gets a bit weird, but the jam opts for triumphant. Nice trio with Tweezer>Lifeboy.
  4/22/94: Starting to wonder if Fishman has ever even seen The Jungle Book?
  4/22/94: Page’s Coil solo flirting with the five-minute mark, longer than most of those first set songs. Heavy on the usual sparkling runs.
  4/22/94: Aww, the traditional Carolina appearance by Page’s pop. Fish joins in on the father-son ragtime piano duet with his washboard.
  4/22/94: Phish fans, to their credit, never fail to go crazy for an old dude singing “Won’t You Come Home, Bill Bailey”
  4/22/94: Dr. Jack even getting a little Tom Waits on the back half of this Bill Bailey.

  4/22/94 Final: Evolution of the ‘94 ADD improv style is back on track in Bowie, Tweezer now that they’re the only jamband in town again.
