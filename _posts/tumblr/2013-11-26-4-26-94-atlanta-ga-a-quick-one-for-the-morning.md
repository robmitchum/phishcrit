  4/26/94 - ATLANTA, GA
  A quick one for the morning - 4/26/94, Atlanta, GA, Purple Dragon Recording Studio. 2nd radio session of the year. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-26 …
  4/26/94: According to @shapsio, this was a “Live X” show, broadcast live on WNNX 99.7 FM (which is now Rock 100.5, says Wikipedia).
  4/26/94: Kind of funny that they would play Atlanta 4/23, go up to TN for two shows, then come back to ATL.
  4/26/94: Definitely looking to sell some records here with Sample and Bouncin’. Tape speed a little slow, so it all sounds sizzurpy.
  4/26/94: A surprisingly chunky Maze for a radio sesh. Trey plays car alarms and motorcycle revs, Fish goes heavy metal on his kick drum.
  4/26/94: More “Write it down” banter in the Disease intro, this time from Trey. Officially a running inside joke.
  RT @nolasox3: @phishcrit @shapsio It was (still is?) the “alternative” station in Atlanta. Lots of Pearl Jam, Pumpkins, etc back in mid-90s.
  4/26/94: Funny to think that they were courting PJ/SP fans with Down w/ Disease and Fluffhead, but that’s 1994 for ya.
  4/26/94: Page using the electric piano instead of the grand really makes these radio sessions feel a lot older.
  4/26/94: The tape speed warping during this Fluffhead jam is like a sneak preview of the digital whammy pedal.
  4/26/94: And now for the oddity of the session, a cover of Sun Ra’s “Carefree.” I did not know this existed before today.
  4/26/94: Interesting…this Carefree sounds like it could be part of a long Tweezer from later in the year. Secret origin of the ADD style?
  4/26/94: As @bourgwick noted, sounds like there’s some Hey-jamming going on. Though they were Hey-ing during Fluffhead’s composed parts too.

  4/26/94 Final: A standard radio set that abruptly sneaks in a fascinating missing link in their improvisational evolution. Oddly essential?
