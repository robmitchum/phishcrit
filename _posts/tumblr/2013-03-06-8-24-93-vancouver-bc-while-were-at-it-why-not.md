  8/24/93 – VANCOUVER, BC
  While we’re at it, why not tackle 8/24/93, Vancouver, BC, Commodore Ballroom. 2nd Vancouver and 5th Canadian show of the year.
  8/24/93: It’s the 4th time this month Chalkdust has opened a show. Starting to settle into the leadoff spot.
  8/24/93: Bouncin’ played “for the spring-loaded floor here” Trey sez. I guess the Commodore Ballroom is the MSG of the Pacific Northwest.
  8/24/93: Page chooses solo soul piano instead of spaciness in the middle of It’s Ice, triggering an I Feel The Earth Move jam.
  8/24/93: Songy first set gets its first chance to stretch with a Melt, but the jam never kicks free of the three-note carriage return.
  8/24/93: The Horse has cut out a lot of the screwing around before the melody proper. Interesting how some songs tighten as others loosen.
  8/24/93: After the break and the westward trip, we’re falling back on spring ‘93 setlist conventions here. Uncle Pen, Maze, Golgi, yawn.
  8/24/93: No spaceship landing for British Columbia…Llama opens set 2 instead of 2001.
  8/24/93: Any Llama momentum (Llamomentum?) squandered by an oddly-placed Horn. This show can’t find its footing.
  8/24/93: That’s a nice little Ya Mar though, rich organ benefitting from SBD, Mike questioning “what’s that mean anyway?”
  8/24/93: One thing Trey never does in Mike’s Song any more is just solo off in his own world instead of playing the riff during the lyrics.
  8/24/93: Second Mike’s jam gets right into dark, heavy, proto-Simple riffing. Thick, burpy bass, random screaming, then sparser.
  8/24/93: Acoustic Ginseng is the 3rd bluegrass song of the show. Guess they spent time practicing hoedowns on their travel days.
  8/24/93: The strangeness of Mike’s > Ginseng > Weekapaug made me realize there hasn’t been a single Hydrogen all of summer ‘93!
  8/24/93: Weekapaug drifts into a weird, atonal corner. Some of the new jamming style seems to be based on “how do we get out of this one?”
  8/24/93: In this instance, the only escape was a segue into Wilson…the easiest of segues.
  8/24/93: No Tweezer in this show, but Trey decides to play the riff anyway during the Suzy breaks. First fast, then slow.
  8/24/93: “This great Neil Diamonds number.” [sic]
  8/24/93: In Antelope, the band cycles through a bunch of patterns on the way up, but again stays within the guardrails. Not that kinda show.
  8/24/93 verdict: A time warp back to spring in setlist construction and improv content. I guess I finally found the ugly duckling of Aug 93.
