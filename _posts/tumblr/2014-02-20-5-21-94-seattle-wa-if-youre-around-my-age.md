  5/21/94 - SEATTLE, WA
  If you’re around my age, you’re very familiar with the Moore Theater, even if you’ve never even been to Seattle. Sit down for any MTV-viewing session in the spring and summer of 1992 and you probably witnessed Eddie Vedder treating the interior of the Moore as his own personal jungle gym in the video for “Even Flow.” The image of Vedder throwing himself onto a sea of rapturous fans was one of the iconic images of grunge — a movement that likely helped steer Phish into its strange stylistic conflict in early 94.
  When Nevermind hit #1 in early 1992, it set off a music industry gold rush for the next cheap,  “underground” band to cross over. Record labels drew inspiration from Nirvana’s cover art and signed up scores of strange, naive underground bands that would normally never pass for marketable. Other labels took a fresh look at their stable and suddenly saw dollar signs in bands previously marked for modest, cult success.
  It’s not hard to imagine that Elektra, in this environment, suddenly expected more album sales from those weird dudes from Vermont they had signed in 1991. And while the dastardly artistic meddling of record labels is oft exaggerated, I’m sure Elektra executives weren’t above a few nudges in the direction of a more polished and radio-friendly direction when Phish went into the studio in the fall of 1993, at the same time In Utero and Pearl Jam’s Vs. each hit #1. After all, Phish wasn’t any weirder than labelmates Ween, who found surprise, Beavis-fueled success with “Push Th’ Little Daisies” in 1992 (and released their own “polished” album in 1994, Chocolate & Cheese*).
  You can’t really blame Phish either. They’d been exhaustively crawling up the venue circuit, had successfully sold out large theaters and played a few sheds in summer 1993, and seemed on the brink of jumping up to a new level of popularity. So they reined in some of their eccentricities, rewrote some lyrics, brought in guest vocalists and horn sections and gospel singers, and tried to write a hit single. The start of the 1994 tour also finds them playing the traditional record promotion game, with radio sessions at stations in New York and Atlanta that, notably, played alternative rock formats.
  But of course, Phish was always going to be a weird fit next to Weezer, Green Day, and Nine Inch Nails. “Sample in a Jar” may not be that far off from Pearl Jam’s “Alive” — both are four-chord, mid-tempo rockers with anthemic choruses, and Jeff Ament’s burpy fretless bass isn’t far off from Mike’s sound at the time — but it sounds too “nice” to be a hit on the angsty airwaves of the middle 90s. Maybe they were just slightly too early, as by the end of the year touring buddies Blues Traveler and Dave Matthews Band would achieve the pop success Elektra wanted from Phish**.
  In the end, Phish and Elektra were both right and wrong about the band’s trajectory — they were about to become one of the largest touring acts in America, but in spite of Hoist and its traditional publicity, not because of it. This show on grunge’s home court is a hilarious demonstration of just how unsuited for the mainstream Phish were — the entire second set is basically a collection of in-jokes with “Sample” marooned in the middle***. But it culminates in a performance of “Harry Hood’ that foreshadows the album that would *really* hook new fans into the Phish world, the one they would record later this year in their natural element.
  * - They Might Be Giants’ John Henry is another 1994 “mainstream-quirk” Elektra parallel that I may get to someday.
  ** - It’s amusing to imagine an alternate dimension where Phish is DMB and DMB is Phish.
  *** - Sample even gets a rare reprise/tease in the intro to Bowie, where it sounds perfectly out of its element.

  Onward to 5/21/94, Seattle, WA, Moore Theatre. aka the venue that Eddie Vedder climbed around in the Even Flow video. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-21/ …
  5/21/94: Nice little jam in the composed part of the Jim opener. Some DDL laser noises preminiscent of Page’s Meatstick synth.
  5/21/94: An unusual, growly Trey tone in the Jim jam proper, with the most predictable follower possible: Foam.
  5/21/94: Extra long pause in Guelah, with whispered “fly” lyric. Then Disease to reassure me I didn’t click on a 93 show by mistake.
  5/21/94: On the heels of a couple baroque, proggy Phish songs is the best place for Disease right now. Its directness makes it soar.
  5/21/94: Plucky opening to the Stash jam is bludgeoned to death by Mike. Then much dissonance/consonance, perfectly timed to today’s essay.
  5/21/94: Page gets a good 4 minutes to solo with a mid-set Coil, followed by Tela. Definitely fan service for the Page Siders here.
  5/21/94: Tela is chased by Llama for a Gamehendgy ending to this set. Some good Trey drones inside.
  5/21/94: Back for Set II, which kicks off with the 1st Dinner and a Movie in 55 shows. Too bad I didn’t do this show on Valentine’s Day.
  5/21/94: Sample tease (1 of only 2 ever) in the Bowie intro, basically everyone but Fish playing the song over the hi-hat.
  5/21/94: Sparse start to Bowie jam (Trey tech problem?) lets a heavy Mike pulse and melodic Page riff into the driver’s seat. It’s nice.
  5/21/94: Trey has been singing something over both Dinner and a Movie and Contact that I can’t quite isolate and place. Any ideas out there?
  5/21/94: @bizarchive alert — Trey is playing “Smoke on the Water” in Big Ball Jam. Or is it “Cat Scratch Fever”? #nevergetsold
  5/21/94: The old BBJ, Fish song novelty double-punch (albeit with Julius between) has this show feeling very 1993 again.
  5/21/94: Before Hood, Trey and Fish goof on unintelligible crowd requests in the 1994 version of Poster Nutbag The Right Way.
  5/21/94: All the set’s slap-happiness is put aside for a really strong, patient Hood jam with a brisk tempo and multiple peaks. Feels good.
  5/21/94: Seattle show, so it’s a BOOM Anguh! encore, of course.
  5/21/94 Final: In the home of over-serious alternative rock, of course Phish plays the jester. Another ’93 throwback, with a towering Hood.
