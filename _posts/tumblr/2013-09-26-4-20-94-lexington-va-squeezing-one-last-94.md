  4/20/94 - LEXINGTON, VA
  Squeezing one last ‘94 show in before Summer Tour. 4/20/94, Lexington, VA, Virginia Horse Center. Horse Center? http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-20/ …
  4/20/94: The Virginia Horse Center really is an equestrian campus. Has to be the weirdest venue of ‘94 so far: http://www.horsecenter.org/About.aspx
  4/20/94: The lengthy breakdown returns to It’s Ice. Galloping piano in the lead with the other three contributing occasional weirdness.
  4/20/94: Two back-to-backers in this show already, Julius and Rift. Weird to see a non-Hoist song get the consecutive show treatment.
  4/20/94: Stash jam starts with a rapid panic attack pulse, does its usual air raid siren thing, then finds a psychotic shuffle resolution.
  4/20/94: Trey banter reveals that DMB opened this show. We were bound to reach this point eventually.
  4/20/94: “Sunshine of Your Love” teases from Page and Trey starting at 3:14 in Suzy. non-urgent cc @bizarchive, who I know is busy today.
  4/20/94: Poor Heart set opener for the first time in almost exactly a year (4/18/93). Just needed an appetizer for Antelope, I guess.
  4/20/94: Fresh coffee, this fiery Antelope, pre-holiday and opening day jitters really making me a ball of nerves here.
  4/20/94: Good to see Magilla still in rotation on the other side of the horns shows. Paul & Silas makes this set a genre sampler platter.
  4/20/94: Trey just worked a brief digital delay loop riff into this Big Ball Jam, instantly making it my favorite Big Ball Jam.
  4/20/94: Mike using his watery DWD pedal at the onset of the Hood jam, making things even more shimmery, like a hot day.
  4/20/94: Brief stumble on the way to that Hood peak, but it still hit the spot when it got there.
  4/20/94: Trey gets to the “Floyd is dead” chorus in Fee too early, laughs, appends “not dead yet.”
  4/20/94: That piercing smooth sax can only mean one thing — DMB has joined in on this YEM. Gonna bite my tongue for the next 10 minutes.
  4/20/94: Thankful for Fish’s vacuum keeping it weird with the DMB dudes on stage. Carter Beauford doing a solid Fish drums impression too.
  4/20/94: I will admit that the DMB YEM hung together way better than the ARU YEM from 5/5/93. #acronymoverload

  4/20/94 Final: Another merely decent show with a strong Antelope, Hood, and a better than expected DMB-crashed YEM. No Horse, ironically.
