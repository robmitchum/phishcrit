5/1/93 - UPPER DARBY, PA
Back after a long hiatus - #phish project show 62: 5/1/93, Upper Darby, PA, Tower Theater. Into the 4th and final month of spring tour.
5/1/93: Runaway Jim seems to be finally spreading its wings a bit, but gets quickly reined in and re-tamed by its traditional buddy, Foam.
5/1/93: While Foaming, found this bizarre tidbit from the wiki entry on the Tower Theater:
5/1/93: “It was not unusual at a Tower show to observe…rock journalists huddling together during the intermission and comparing notes.”
5/1/93: The trick to a successfully scary Melt appears to be each member playing at a different tempo for as long as possible. #secrets
5/1/93: Don’t like to focus on flubs, but they didn’t just miss the dismount on that Melt jam, they snapped both legs.
5/1/93: A treasured bustout - first Sample in 9 shows. (aside: there is a team named “Sample in a Jair” in my FBB league, and it’s not me)
5/1/93: The doodling in this Bowie intro sounds like a mix of Morricone and the underground theme from Super Mario.
5/1/93: There’s an extra chord thrown into the progression of this Bowie jam that reminds me of Worcester 98’s Mirror in the Bathroom.
5/1/93: Not much to say about this 2nd set so far - whole lot of sticking to the script. Acoustic Fluffhead > MFMF transition only quirk.
5/1/93: Love me a good Page solo, but never see the reasoning behind a mid-set Coil. Bathroom breaks?
5/1/93: This set needs a big jam desperately, but in the meantime the odd pair Halley’s > Paul & Silas will suffice in holding my interest.
5/1/93: Must confess to growing a little tired of the standard “quiet jam” in the middle of each ‘93 Weekapaug. #jadedvet
5/1/93 verdict: Lot of May ‘93 boosters in my @ replies, but I was a bit lukewarm on this particular show. Melt still killing it, at least.
