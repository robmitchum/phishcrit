3/18/93 - HOLLYWOOD, CA


I considered actually reviewing a DMB show, but that was going too far. Instead, #phish project show 31: 3/18/93, Hollywood, CA, The Palace2:12 PM Apr 1st via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Nothing to say about a Chalkdust, Guelah, Rift opening. Hey, Trey’s megaphone is back for Fee, that’s a thing!2:39 PM Apr 1st via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Disclaimer - I’ve been sneaking listens to Mr. Miner’s great comp of Aug. ‘93 (http://bit.ly/avY1SJ) which blows March away.2:51 PM Apr 1st via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Ahh, a Forbin’s to shake things up. Narration: band and audience are holograms in a box that gets thrown into the deep sea…April 1, 2010 3:04:02 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: …which eventually reaches the earth’s core where they find Gamehendge and so on and so forth. Come back in 3 shows for more.April 1, 2010 3:04:45 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: And we’re back to all-songs, no-improv with Sparkle, Horn, I Didn’t Know. I think this is my punishment for the DMB jokes.April 1, 2010 3:22:16 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Trey introduces character actor George DiCenzo (http://bit.ly/aGQh5Q) in the crowd and claims that he is his godfather. T/F?April 1, 2010 3:42:31 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Bowie walks the straight path, until about 10 minutes when it gets pretty trill. A sprinkle of diginoise to enhance the effect.April 1, 2010 3:56:43 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Set II opener My Friend My Friend contains a long, out-of-season Little Drummer Boy jam, which is absurd enough to bode well.April 1, 2010 4:04:43 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Split jam kicks off with Trey riding the Stayin’ Alive riff, then cuts a spiraling groove that builds & bursts. It’s getting there.April 1, 2010 4:18:44 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: There were interesting parts in this YEM that were washed out by a long, terrible drum solo. Did someone need to use the bathroom?April 1, 2010 5:11:51 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: Good news - Fish song segment (“If I Only Had a Brain”) is only 6min, 1min of which is Trey listing his nicknames. Relief.April 1, 2010 5:26:31 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93: I never have anything to say re: Page solos at the end of Coil, but I love them. Need to make a mix that’s just endless Coil solos.April 1, 2010 5:35:26 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/18/93 verdict: Took until Night 2, Set 2 of this run to warm up; the Stayin’ Alive Melt is the only keeper. LA is just not Phish’s town.April 1, 2010 5:46:47 PM CDT via TweetDeck
