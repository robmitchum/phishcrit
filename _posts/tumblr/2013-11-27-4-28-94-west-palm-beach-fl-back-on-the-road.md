  4/28/94 - WEST PALM BEACH, FL
  Back on the road with 4/28/94, West Palm Beach, FL, Sunfest. Another one-setter, this time for a festival. http://phish.in/1994-04-28
  4/28/94: Also at Sunfest, acc to @phishnet: Joan Baez, Blues Traveler, Huey Lewis & The News, Los Lobos, The Village People, Ziggy Marley.
  4/28/94: And according to this Sun Sentinel article, Sunfest also featured a 6-foot tall Lambchop puppet. #TheHorror http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-03-24/news/9403240041_1_sunfest-reggae-festival …
  4/28/94: As the first outdoor show of ’94, this is an appropriately wind-blown AUD. Standard Jim Foam opener for the custies.
  4/28/94: I can already tell I’m going to be reaching for things to say about this set, so — hey @bizarchive, Dixie tease at 5:47 of Foam.
  4/28/94: Still very much in the box, but the band is getting more comfortable with the Disease outro. Trey winding around the progression.
  4/28/94: Some 40 minutes into the show we finally get some openish improv in a hard-driving, Page-showcase It’s Ice breakdown.
  4/28/94: Magilla gets tossed around in the first segment of Antelope, Trey repeats a nice pattern for the 2nd, before going Hero Ball.
  4/28/94: “Thanks a lot, now we’re getting warmed up here a little bit.” - Trey, agreeing with me.
  4/28/94: Page keeps it tidy for his Coil solo, and now we’re back into album promo mode with Julius. Sigh, festie sets.
  4/28/94: To be fair, Trey kinda slays the Julius solo, with extra-raunchy tone for the era. I mean, it’s still Julius, but it’s a good one.
  4/28/94: Sparkle & GTBT is a good high energy pairing to end a set, and also a good way to get it over with quickly.

  4/28/94 Final: Imagine Elektra calling Phish and cussing them out for playing Sun Ra in a radio session. This limp show is the result.
