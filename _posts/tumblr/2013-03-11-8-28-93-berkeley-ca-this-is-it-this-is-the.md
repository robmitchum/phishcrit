  8/28/93 – BERKELEY, CA
  This is it. This is the final Summer ‘93 show. 8/28/93, Berkeley, CA, William Randolph Hearst Greek Theatre. #Rosebud
  8/28/93: I did not know that JJ Cale opened this show, and that Trey & Mike sat in for “After Midnight” 6+ years before Big Cypress.
  8/28/93: Llama > Bouncin whiiiiiplaaaaash
  8/28/93: The Greek is such a weird venue. It looks like they’re playing at the Lincoln Memorial: http://bit.ly/WdesE2
  8/28/93: Trey chat! “We’re going to take a long time off after this.” A whole four months, quite the hiatus.
  8/28/93: Maybe it’s the SBD, maybe it’s end-of-tour relief, but they sound particularly crisp this night. Confident acoustic Ginseng.
  8/28/93: Speaking of which, few Phish things benefit more from SBD than Page’s Maze solo. Spin Leslie Spin!
  8/28/93: Trey effect question/speculation - is the “check it out” part of Fluffhead the first place he started using the DDL pedal?
  8/28/93: Stash marks the first deep exploratory dive of the show, placing some JJ Cale-ish soloing in an unstable environment.
  8/28/93: What they learned on their summer vacation - when it seemed like the jam was wrapping up, there’s one last relapse of dissonance.
  8/28/93: Another fine pre-Page solo jam in Coil. Those subtly interlocking parts are pretty foundational for 94’s jamming style.
  8/28/93: Second Dude of Life appearance of the month, for Crimes of the Mind again. Still a cool riff.
  8/28/93: And Set II begins with…Trey singing “Constant Craving” over the start of 2001? Oh 1993…
  8/28/93: Extensive Brady Bunch theme teases in Antelope. So, Brady Bunch and kd lang so far this set…interesting reference pool.
  8/28/93: Entire band playing a riff like a roller coaster going over a hill over and over and over again. Risky after lunch.
  8/28/93: Very fragmented Antelope jam. Breaking up the ascent with quieter, darker interludes. One sounded like deconstructed Buried Alive.
  8/28/93: They are giving It’s Ice a workout at the end of this tour…played 5 times in the last 8 shows.
  8/28/93: Jazzy It’s Ice breakdown, arcing towards disorder. Then a final secret language sampler for the year.
  8/28/93: This set is a return to traditional ‘93 rules: Jam vehicle in the third slot, Big Ball Jam, Fish song (Purple Rain).
  8/28/93: Phish flirts with Oye Como Va so often, it’s very nice when a full embrace happens (as it does in this here YEM).
  8/28/93: Vocal jam contains hints of the Muppets “Mahna Mahna” song, and now I’m shocked it doesn’t more often: http://bit.ly/14qFslE
  8/28/93: Now the vocal jam is in a weird pseudo chopped & screwed place that sounds like Timbaland on “Cry Me A River”
  8/28/93: Based on the amount of music post-Fish segment in this show, I think somebody misestimated the curfew at the Greek.
  8/28/93: Trey at end of set: “See you guys next Spring or New Year’s Eve or something.”
  8/28/93: Ooh the last show excitement of crew introductions. Done inside Daniel Saw The Stone this time around, to keep Fish busy.
  8/28/93: Oh sweet and a light solo. Always good to “hear.”
  8/28/93: “This venue was built for acoustic…this, that and the other thing.” - Trey Anastasio, sound expert.
  8/28/93: Kind of the second tour to end this year with Amazing Grace? 5/8/93 has an AC/DC Bag encore, but who’s counting.
  8/28/93 verdict: A competent show closes out an historic tour. The end of August steps back a bit on the improv, tbh. But it will be back.
