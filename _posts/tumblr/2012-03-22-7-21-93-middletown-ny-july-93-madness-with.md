7/21/93 - MIDDLETOWN, NY 
July ‘93 Madness with 7/21/93, Middletown, NY, Orange County Fairgrounds. HORDE Fest!
7/21/93: Jumping right in to this one-setter by extending the 2001 streak to 4. The fastest version yet, clocking in under 3 minutes.
7/21/93: Other bands on this HORDE stop, per @phishnet: Allgood, ARU, Big Head Todd, Blues Traveler, The Samples, and Widespread.
Haha #festivalset RT @neddyo: @phishcrit one of my least favorite shows!
RT @neddyo: @phishcrit not only that, but there was some weird dispute w/ vendors, had to wait outside for hours so everything was compressed further.
7/21/93: Well the Split isn’t terrible, though it is pretty straightforward. Some caustic drones from Trey over the storm.
7/21/93: They just can’t stay away from the early/mid-set Coils. Page keeps it brief and chordy, with a little Dixieland.
7/21/93: Whatever the rest of the band did during their Coil solo break produced an intense, itchy Maze. More conversing than soloing.
7/21/93: That was actually one of the best Mazes I’ve heard in ‘93. Don’t sleep on it.
7/21/93: Glide played “a la Coventry” for a few moments there.
7/21/93: Per @gregschwartz, Phish played last after Blues Traveler (w/ injured Popper) and Widespread Panic. Hence the curfew issues.
7/21/93: Runaway Jim strays off the beaten path enough to be interesting, some quiet repetition before entering full gallop.
7/21/93: Things winding down with the novelty portion of the night (Big Ball Jam, 3rd Purple Rain in 4 shows).
7/21/93: Trey after Daniel: “Thanks everybody, unfortunately we have run out of time…wish we could play longer but we can’t.”
7/21/93 verdict: Despite what sounds like bummer circumstances and a short set, there are sleeper gems here in Maze and Jim.
