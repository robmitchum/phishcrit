  4/21/94 - WINSTON-SALEM, NC
  Now resuming 1994 service until Fall Tour. 4/21/94, Winston-Salem, NC, Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-21/ …
  4/21/94: Chalkdust, Sparkle and Foam welcoming me back to the past with a warm, spirited, kind of predictable embrace.
  4/21/94: Half-hearted attempt at “Dixie” in Trey’s Foam solo makes me think we need a community term for failed teases.
  4/21/94: Plenty of sound, plenty of fury, not much signifying in this Melt. Has it lost something in the jump to basketball arenas?
  4/21/94: Hearing Lizards reminds me how nice it was to get that one towards the end of a rough weekend in Chicago this summer.
  4/21/94: The summer tour intermission was helpful in delaying my psychotic break from hearing Disease every damn show.
  4/21/94: There have been many opportunities for Page to get all emotional on the piano keys this set (Foam, Lizards, If I Could).
  4/21/94: It still clocks in under four minutes, but something about the ambient intro to this 2001 felt deeper than usual for the era.
  4/21/94: The 2001 > Maze that opened this set appeared to set the course for dark spaces, but Fluffhead is ruining those plans.
  4/21/94: Jamband scandal! Dave Matthews not invited back on the tramps for Mike’s, audience volunteer chosen instead.
  4/21/94: Mike’s 2nd jam settles into a quiet, creepy heartbeat, laced with horror organ. Hydrogen returns to the middle…with lyrics?
  4/21/94: Acc to @phishnet, those lyrics (“I walk awakening on the misty fields of forever”) have turned up in 6 versions of Hydrogen. Huh.
  4/21/94: Thought we were headed for the first proper Mule duel during Page’s “difficult” solo, but nope, no Trey response.
  4/21/94: These arena-sized Big Ball Jams are getting shorter and shorter - only 2:19 on this one. Not that I’m complaining, mind you.
  4/21/94: Can’t help but note Possum, only getting played once every 6-8 shows in spring 94, sounds way fresher than modern-day versions.
  4/21/94: Jeez, a no-mics Amazing Grace in the 14k-capacity Lawrence Joel Coliseum? And somehow the taper caught it.
  4/21/94: Now for the obligatory superjam with DMB, which of course follows traditional superjam protocol of Drums > Jam > Dylan Cover.
  4/21/94: After 2 consecutive shows with them, I can almost hang with these DMB jams if not for the sax (and, yikes, Dave vox on Watchtower).
  4/21/94: Pretty awesome Trey solo in Watchtower followed by what sounds like Boyd Tinsley sawing a log for 3 minutes.

  4/21/94 Final: A second night with DMB threatens to infect the band with jam-less mediocrity. Escape! Before it’s too late!
