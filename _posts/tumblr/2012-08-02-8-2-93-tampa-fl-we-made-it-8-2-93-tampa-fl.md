8/2/93 - TAMPA, FL
We made it. 8/2/93, Tampa, FL, Ritz Theatre. Are you strapped in? Do you have your helmet on? 

8/2/93: It feels like we’ve been here before: http://bit.ly/MTkc3c  

8/2/93: Chalkdust opener - a fitting way to launch the month that gave birth to peak-era Phish? Kinda rare for the time, 1st of the summer. 

8/2/93: Sounded like some “Train Kept A Rollin” teases in the Chalkdust solo. @bizarchive? 

8/2/93: First impression is that this show is very high tempo. Fishman threatens to out-pace the band on both Chalkdust & Poor Heart. 

8/2/93: And the first debut of the night is Brother, making its 93 bow (if you don’t count the Antelope jam on 7/18). ~5 fans are psyched. 

8/2/93: I always like the weird, sheets of noise soloing in the Brother jam. Sorta similar to what Trey tries to do on Light sometimes. 

8/2/93: Anyway, see ya in 258 shows at the Clifford Ball, Brother. 

8/2/93: Set’s manic pace still hasn’t let up. Pretty long Trey dropout in ATR, so call it the “piano trio version.” 

8/2/93: The first Gin of the summer; in fact, the first of only two. Hmm, I wonder what happens in the next one… 

8/2/93: Slow deliberate jam turns into tease of…OK, have to disagree with @phishnet, sounds more like “Curtis Loew” than “Sweet Virginia”? 

8/2/93: Really like the 2min of Gin jam before the Makisupa segue, sounds a bit like a full band detour in a Mule duel. 

8/2/93: Fantastic demented segue between Makisupa and MMGAMOIO. This show is already much more creative than anything in July. 

8/2/93: Ha, Dog Log introduced with the “What song is it you want to hear?” Freebird quote. 

8/2/93: The La Grange gap before this show (310 shows) just beat out the gap before the SPAC bustout (301 shows). 

8/2/93: What a crazy set. Five tour debuts, including three 1993 debuts, two of which wouldn’t be played again for years. Rulebook burned. 

RT @GuyForgetOPT @phishcrit Funny that a 300 show gap back then spanned 2 years, and now it’s 13. 

8/2/93: The setbreak did not slow this show down AT ALL. Exhibit A: Mike’s morphing into a track tagged “Heavy Metal Jam.” 

8/2/93: …complete with Bruce Dickinson-like vocals from someone named Joe Rooney of the band First Born? <shrug> http://mysp.ac/N5SwnS  

8/2/93: First Sparks in 392 shows, last Curtis Loew until the Cypress soundcheck/Fenway. All for a Tampa crowd on a Monday night. 

8/2/93: This might be the best Phish show for a workout I’ve ever found. Burn off those calories with 8/2/93 (Consult your doctor first). 

8/2/93: Given the torrid pacing of this show, I’m going to forgive them this mid-set Coil/water break. Above-average, unique Page solo too. 

8/2/93: This show even has a pretty epic HYHU. “Henrietta…reborn…IN VERMONT!” 

8/2/93: Official site sez: “Fish was fighting a fever this day and feeling so poorly the band considered cancelling the show.” 

8/2/93: Maybe I’m just exhausted, maybe the band is, maybe both. But I wasn’t feeling this Antelope, despite all the tease/reprise tricks. 

8/2/93: This show earned its Sleeping Monkey encore. 

RT @ZaWheelZ @phishcrit it was also about 130 degrees in that club. Maybe even warmer. 

8/2/93 verdict: What a fun show, though more for song selection/segues than improv. Still, I wonder how a “bustout show” went over in 1993?
