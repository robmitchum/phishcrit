5/5/93 - ALBANY, NY
OK, working on the tumblr broke the seal, so here’s #phish project show 65: 5/5/93, Albany, NY, Palace Theatre. Final Four of Spring ‘93.
5/5/93: Rift, Guelah, Foam - feels like the band is saying goodbye to their default Spring ‘93 setlist after three months.
5/5/93: First jam of the night, in Stash, is noisy without being particularly interesting. Shaking the cobwebs after the final off day.
5/5/93: Longer space than usual in the middle of It’s Ice - broken music-boxes and frayed-cord feedback. Good to see it maturing.
RT @neddyo @robmitchum awesome, here’s my reminisces from those last shows: weeklyned.blogspot.com/2008/05/nedsta…
5/5/93: A good run of old-fashioned Phishy evil (Ice > Glide > Maze), ends with a strong, M:I tease-laced Maze, long for its age.
5/5/93: Humorous premature “woah-oh!” by Trey in this Jim prompts some extra mustard in the jam, including a crazy long note and hot drums.
5/5/93: …and a surprisingly fluid Jim > MFMF segue complete with electric-to-acoustic guitar swap. Dang guys.
5/5/93: The “he’s got a knife” outro to MFMF is a pretty weird place to find a Manteca jam. I like it though, I like pretty weird.
5/5/93: Kind of early for a Big Ball Jam, ain’t it? This show has a “racing to beat the curfew” smell to it.
5/5/93: Nothing says 1993 like a Spin Doctors tease (Two Princes in Ya Mar). Trey dedicated song to his future wife Sue, so I’ll blame her.
5/5/93: This YEM is 32 minutes long?! Better take a bathroom break.
5/5/93: Ohhh, this is a superjam with Aquarium Rescue Unit (“nothing says 1993” Pt. 2). Was never a fan, and the mega-noodling here is why.
5/5/93: I do not enjoy this. Just when I thought two jambands jamming together couldn’t get any worse…out comes the vacuum.
5/5/93: This awful jam is what I imagine Phish sounds like to normal people when I make them listen to Phish.
5/5/93: OK, random “Take the A-Train” in the middle of Cavern, you have helped me forgive some of the previous 32 minutes.
5/5/93 verdict: A flashback to early HORDE days, for worse or even worse. Before that mess, scarce highlights in Maze, Jim, MFMF. Sorry :(
