2/25/93: Love the secret language, but its every-night appearance is really dragging down Bowie intros. Nice Jeopardy jam though.11:02 AM Jan 7th from web 
2/25/93: Forbin narration has venue turned up-side down and swept away by wave to Gamehendge. Gilligan’s Island jam as background.10:26 AM Jan 7th from web  
2/25/93: Forbin cues a tutorial for FL crowds on Phish mythology - “I know it’s a confusing song if you don’t know what it’s about.”10:17 AM Jan 7th from web
