4/29/93 - MONTREAL, QC
OK #phish project show 60: 4/29/93, Montreal, QC, Le Spectrum. French Canada gets a taste. (also qualifies for #musicdiaryproject)
4/29/93: Soundcheck Bonus - So-called “Reggae Jam” actually sounds like a 7-min jam on the Davy Crockett theme song, then solo-trading.
4/29/93: Hey now, Melt opener? 1st time that’s happened on this tour. Evil Trey tone, lurching rhythm. Sends a message. #holdontight
4/29/93: Strange setlist tilting towards the nimble and aggressive - Uncle Pen, Sloth, both played FAST. Unusually warm after a day off.
4/29/93: Horn is the only brief breather before Llama kicks it up again. Must have been a lot of, um, coffee backstage.
4/29/93: If we’re running through the high-tempo repertoire, of course you gotta invite Rift. This set is palpitation-inducing.
4/29/93: Oh yeah, duh - “a ship to Quebec” #feefeefeefee
4/29/93: Early digi-jam sighting as Trey loops the Fee coda harmonics into Antelope intro.
4/29/93: Intense set pays off in one of the best Antelopes of the tour. “Money” teases, creative tangents in 2nd section. Sweaty.
4/29/93: OK so no drop in energy over the setbreak. Chalkdust has scratchy interludes, more “Money” teases.
4/29/93: Frequency of Ya Mar picks up as the weather warms, as it should. Also: “Play it Leo…don’t play it yet!”
4/29/93: Pretty unhinged, interesting Ya Mar actually. In a good way, not like that Walnut Creek ‘03 disaster: http://bit.ly/gdCbO7 #oof
4/29/93: One of those Rebas where they set the tempo faster than they can actually play it. Usually a good sign for the jam.
4/29/93: Interesting variant on the usual Mike’s riff in the jam, might be a tease, don’t want to peek at phish.net…
4/29/93: Was not aware that Hydrogen could be played in a Gene Autry country ballad style…until NOW.
4/29/93: Weekapaug is ADD like woah - Irish jig, sudden drop into Makisupa (first since ‘90!), speed-up jam, funk, start-stop, CYHMK teases.
4/29/93: That Weekapaug was like a Fiery Furnaces medley - here’s 10 genres of music in 10 minutes.
4/29/93 verdict: Even by ‘93 standards, the energy in this show is in the red. Works like a charm for Antelope, Weekapaug, Melt. Rager.
