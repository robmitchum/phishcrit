Last night was a very good show, particularly the second set, which showed what infusing new/recent/less-frequently-played material can do for the band’s creativity. Three moments in particular stuck out to me as encouraging evidence that they are rapidly getting on the same page, raising my optimism about the tour and year to come.
1. Cities
With few exceptions, first sets have become a warmup for the band in 3.0, so I tend to look for the little sparks that suggest that the second frame is going to ignite. There was one in the transition between Cities and Bowie that perked my ears up — and the SPAC crowd heard it as well, judging by the spontaneous cheer.

2. Light
It feels like every year in 3.0 starts with Trey trying to wrangle his whammy pedal/whale call into agreement with the rest of the band, and Light has been the most frequent site of these battles. That tension returned in last night’s version, where the first segment of the jam recapitulated Trey’s Bangor struggles to mesh with the band — he seems to go in and out of sync with the other three like a flickering radio signal. Last night’s resolved into a funk chord segment that smacked of wheel-spinning (similar to the previous night’s Golden Age), before Trey chose a truly weird, jarring chord progression right around the 10-minute mark that could have easily derailed the entire journey. But then, just when the ripcord felt inevitable, a pillow-soft landing that led to an inventively-explored patient final few minutes. Finding a safe path out of a stumble is Phish at the height of their powers.

3. Slave
One of my more unpopular Phish opinions is that I usually find the Slave jam to be rather boring — the kind of linear build to a peak that is the primary move of every jamband on Earth. Like a lot of other songs (Hood, Reba, Antelope, Bowie), Slave is much better when it takes a few detours along the way. So it was very gratifying to hear Trey grab the reins of what appeared to be your standard off-the-shelf Slave and take — well, not so much a hard right turn, but the slower, scenic route along a frontage road. It’s a deep breath that made the final sprint that much more satisfying.
