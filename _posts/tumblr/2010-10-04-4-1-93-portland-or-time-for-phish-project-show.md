4/1/93 - PORTLAND, OR
Time for #phish project show 41: 4/1/93, Portland, OR, Roseland Theater. Into the third month of coverage! 8:53 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Pre-clapping, crowd just goes “WOAAHH” in unison during Stash pauses. Page pushes into a couple min of WOAH-worthy atonal fright. 9:19 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Predictable song choice derailed by mid-set Coil; placement causes piano solo to stay within the melody more than usual. 9:30 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Another cool, scary MFMF outro; vocal jam over horror movie guitar riff and intermittent percussion clatter. Bring it back! 9:39 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Really clumsy transition on Antelope begets an INTENSE second section - very modern tension-release patterns. Barracuda jam in 3rd. 10:13 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Rift in the first set, Curtain in the second - sort of an inverted Curtain With, am i right? #phishjokes #isthisthingon 10:22 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
  4/1/93: I think 3.0 #phish has ruined Possum for me forever. This one is long and kinda redundant after Antelope. 10:34 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93: Might be the longest Tweezer of the tour so far, goes through a few distinct sections, but nothing really memorable. Blues riffs. 11:03 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
  4/1/93: Ha, and there’s the April Fools joke - Trey introduces Neil Young, huge crowd roar, Fishman comes out instead, crowd boos. 11:10 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
  4/1/93: Trey: “That was too funny, you just totally believed that…helping us out on our next number, on saxophone, Mr. Bill Clinton.” 11:27 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
  4/1/93 verdict: April Fool’s joke (apparently I missed NY teases earlier in show) and Antelope are the highlights. Slow 2-night run though. 11:51 AM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
  BREAKING NEWS: #phish played another show on 4/1/93 - the “Ancient Forests Benefit” in Portland’s Waterfront Park. http://bit.ly/9UySlv 1:21 PM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93a: Emcee Intro: “They brought their voices here, they love the trees, please welcome the Phish!” 1:24 PM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
4/1/93a verdict: Consists of only two acapella songs (Amazing Grace, I Didn’t Know w/o vacuum), makes me think they were a last-min invite. 1:27 PM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
Footnote: also at Tolkien-ish Ancient Forests Benefit: Neil, Crosby, Wilson sisters. Tape fades out on chant of “Clinton/Gore, Cut No More” 1:28 PM Sep 16th via TweetDeck
