  4/11/94 - DURHAM, NH
  4/11/94, Amherst Durham, NH, Snively Arena at the University of New Hampshire. Last stop before Broadway. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-11 …
  4/11/94: A Caravan opener? After the Magilla opener on 4/9, I spot a trend, though the trend might be The Waning Days of Phish-Jazz.
  4/11/94: Some atypical comps during Page’s Foam solo. Always seemed like Foam could be a mellower Maze if it wanted.
  4/11/94: And here’s a Magilla too, after a surprisingly early FEFY. Mellow set all around, maybe Trey’s injury adrenaline has faded.
  4/11/94: I have no idea why I said this show was in “Amherst, NH” earlier. It’s Durham, NH. Sorry Live Free or Diers.
  4/11/94: Cavern wraps up a really conservative first set, other than the jazz treats. Lots of playing it safe in these early 94 arena shows.
  4/11/94: It took seven whole shows, but 2001 is back in its second set opener slot for the first time this year. Still in radio edit form.
  4/11/94: Another 94 first of a 93 staple — Forbin’s > Mock, making a rare second set appearance. Narration is floating, floating, then…
  4/11/94: WE FALL INTO A HUGE HOLE. “But this isn’t the hole that I fell in yesterday, so you’re not going to end up with torn ligaments.”
  4/11/94: Trampoline duties performed by Trey’s understudy, “Brad, the guy who throws the balls out.”
  4/11/94: Haha, the dueling “Sunshine of Your Love”/”Sunshine of Your Life” teases in YEM. Love it.
  4/11/94: Oh wow, YEM vocal jam based on My Soul, 3 years before its debut. I hate My Soul, but that’s still interesting.
  4/11/94: Nice breakdown to plinko/pizzicato scale in the Possum encore, with more Sunshine of Your Love referencing.
  4/11/94: Parting advice from Trey “Don’t fall in any holes” and “Whatever you do, take care of your ankle.” #HealthTips
  4/11/94 Final: Late hijinks stir up an otherwise sterile show. They sound tight, in both senses of the word, heading into the Beacon run.
