4/20/93 - COLUMBUS, OH 
This will be #phish project show 53: 4/20/93, Columbus, OH, Newport Music Hall. Uh-oh, April 20th, never a good day to see a jamband.
4/20/93: Ever the diplomats, Phish is following up two nights in Ann Arbor with a two-night run in Columbus. #cantweallgetalong
4/20/93: Jim Weigh is the new Jim Foam opener, apparently. Cartoony opening (Sparkle too) gets shivved by a psychotic Stash.
4/20/93: Perhaps for the sake of those 4/20ing, the set gets light again post-Stash. But both It’s Ice & Glide have their evil underbelly.
4/20/93: This might be the first show where the quality of the spreadsheet’s AUD is bumming me out - sounds like the mic is under a pillow.
4/20/93: Nice little Lawn Boy jam in the Bowie intro. Interesting melody in the jam that sounds like a depressed “Safety Dance.”
4/20/93: Setbreak entertainment - found this article about the origins of 420 in response to Q from @bourgwick: http://huff.to/d483vk
4/20/93: Band opts for Fluffhead instead of an early second-set jam, but it has a nice unique anti-peak at least, ending on a quiet note.
4/20/93: Crowd members yelling for Harpua between songs. The more things change, etc., etc., cliche, etc.
4/20/93: Was going to make fun of a typo on these mp3s, but apparently “Avenu Malcanu” is an accepted alternate spelling. I go w/ “Malkenu”
4/20/93: Longer Mission: Impossible teases than usual over YEM tramps. Then a dip into quiet jamming, the official trick of spring ‘93.
4/20/93: Fishman breaks out the only Whipping Post of the year for his song. Got a soft spot for this one, since I saw it at my 1st show.
4/20/93 verdict: Sometimes the band just plays a big pile of songs.
