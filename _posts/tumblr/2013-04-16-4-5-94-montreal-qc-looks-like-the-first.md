  4/5/94 - MONTREAL, QC
  Looks like the first “normal” show of 1994 is north of the border and en français. 4/5/94, Montreal, QC, The Metropolis.
  4/5/94: A standard old-school Jim > Foam opener to remind us that evolution doesn’t always line up with calendar flips.
  4/5/94: Fluffhead > Glide and this show is still indistinguishable from 93 in a blind taste test. But then, Julius, which gets a nice cheer.
  4/5/94: Both Juliuses so far have featured some CYHMK flirtation in the jam that would make me a bigger fan of this song had it stuck.
  4/5/94: OTOH, considering Phish circa 94 were maybe the whitest band in music history, hearing them mimic the gospel ad-libs is #wince.
  4/5/94: Bouncin and Rift and we officially have an Intro to Phish set. Funny, since they played a pretty hot show in Montreal on 4/29/93.
  4/5/94: Hey, Peaches to open Set II, nice call. Glad you’re sticking around, Peaches. Seems like they’re avoiding 2001, at least to start.
  4/5/94: Says something about how jam-less this show has been that the Ya Mar solos provided its most creative moments so far.
  4/5/94: First Tweezer of the year to the rescue? Nah, still ‘93 style - a promising riff dissolves to soloing, then slow-down ending.
  4/5/94: If I Could is the second Hoist back-to-backer, but it’s another great version, so I’ll pardon it.
  4/5/94: Nice sparse funk section at the onset of the YEM jam, before a typical build and a vocal jam segue into I Wanna Be Like You.
  4/5/94: Sounds like Fish is on Trey’s megaphone for the first verse of I Wanna Be Like You to get an old-timey vocal effect?
  4/5/94: Well, they’ve now officially trained audience dummies to yell “Freebird” during no-mics a cappella songs, so that’s that ruined.
  4/5/94: First Nellie Kane of the year is electric, so the acoustic setup stays in storage. Looking forward to Rev. Jeff in the fall.
  4/5/94 Final: More of a typical early-tour jitters show than the opener. Minimal jamming, but set structure may be opening up a little?
