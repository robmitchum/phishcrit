…and that they could create new sounds on the spot, and that songs/shows really had no limit. This is why I started in 2/93. Rating 8/10.12:27 PM Dec 16th from web 
…Eventually (as the Hood jam hints), they found that they can explore this way without lifting melodies and themes from other songs…12:26 PM Dec 16th from web 
…really hear the band finding the boundaries of what can be done in a single set and jumping over them to greener grass.12:25 PM Dec 16th from web 
…and while the teases and covers are kind of cartoony (and mostly stay within the catalog), it’s the first occasion where you can…12:25 PM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93 verdict: This is really an unprecedented show - nowhere in the setlists can you find a prior example of such segue insanity…12:23 PM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Sleeping Monkey encore - is this where SM gets its reputation as a marker of a legendary show?12:13 PM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: The way this Hood jam keeps fluttering off into silence is really beautiful, and requires some insane band communication.12:05 PM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Wow, forgot how great this Hood is…long, drippy intro & really pleasurable, patient build after the ADD insanity of earlier.12:03 PM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Set slows down with Terrapin; love Page prodding Fish to hurry it up amidst endless band/crew introductions with HYHU riff.11:47 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Note to #phish 2009 critics - even this classic set has a “cooldown” song in Fast Enough For You.11:36 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Again, they clearly have no idea how to play Have Mercy or the Kiss cover in Weekapaug, but spontaneity wins out.11:33 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Kung is also the exact moment that any audience members unfamiliar with Phish probably call the cops/fled in horror.11:23 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Thanks to this tape, I didn’t realize Kung and the Vibration of Life were two separate…songs?…until much later.11:22 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: And with MMGAMOIO, they’re officially playing songs they don’t remember how to play - but screw it!11:18 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Trey plays half the Phish catalog in Mike’s jam, it’s just free-association proto-mashup heaven. “Lizards” riff is most epic.11:15 AM Dec 16th from web 
RT @austinmn dig the tweezer line at the beginning of mike’s…fits perfect in the key/tempo11:13 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: TweezerMike’s brings tease count to 5. Always loved the “Sing us your song!” cheerleading on this one.11:11 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Tease count up to 4 with Tweezer riff in Glide - harder to pull off the tease in the middle of a composed section!11:08 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Segue back to Tweezer ain’t so smooth but the groove they settle into is years ahead of its time - almost 97-level funky.11:04 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: And then Tweezer jam immediately settles into Low Rider riff (tease count: 3) before classic segue into Walk Away.11:01 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: …you know it’s not a normal show.10:56 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: And there it is: when the band starts rapping what I think is supposed to be Das EFX’s “Straight Out the Sewer” over Tweezer…10:56 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Reba, arguably the last sane song in this set, is sloppy, but excitingly so - the constant threat of falling apart adds drama.10:47 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Credit Mike with opening up the tease-fest floodgates by playing that little “Iron Man” riff at the end of Wilson.10:33 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93: Energy is high in the room; lots of strange whoops in Wilson intro. Dark, elongated Wilson intro again endorses pre-chant days.10:32 AM Dec 16th from web 
2/20/93 Set II - let’s do this crazy thing. #phish10:26 AM Dec 16th from web 
Also, #phish followers, I will tackle 2/20/93 Set II tomorrow. Sorry for the unexpectedly busy day.6:52 PM Dec 15th from web
2/20/93: And a nice scream from Trey to punctuate Cavern and close the set - maybe for the Gene Simmons impersonator in the front row?11:30 AM Dec 15th from web
2/20/93: Composition-heavy first frame continues with a solid Fluffhead; only flubs of the set have, oddly enough, been on Silent in the AM.11:23 AM Dec 15th from web 
@austinmn Not as much reverb on the SBD as I’ve heard on some other 2/93 shows, but definitely there. Must have been the style back then.11:08 AM Dec 15th from web in reply to austinmn 
2/20/93: Oh for the days when they had nothing to do but practice. Not a note out of place in either All Things Reconsidered or Divided.10:47 AM Dec 15th from web 
2/20/93: Weirdly for an officially-released SBD, Trey is pretty quiet in this mix. Not that I mind, but Possum lost some teeth as a result.10:37 AM Dec 15th from web 
2/20/93: Turns out this show has a first set too - who knew? Golgi, Foam, Sloth all played with a tightness rarely seen today.10:26 AM Dec 15th from web 
@thom_pson One of my first tapes too! I think it’s probably in the unofficial Phish starter kit (or at least was in the mid-to-late 90s).10:19 AM Dec 15th from web in reply to thom_pson 

#phish project show 15 is a big one: 2/20/93 Atlanta, GA, Roxy Theatre. Popular, but also very important, which I’ll get into later.10:06 AM Dec 15th from web
