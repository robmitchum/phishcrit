2/3/93 Verdict: Solid, songy show with lots of wackiness & new piano, but first-show jamz are rusty. Good for calibrating the scale - 5/104:44 PM Sep 4th from web
2/3/93: Weird YEM, with My Girl teases and alternate lyrics; phish.net says they were “Water your team in a beehive I’m a sent you” <shrug>3:49 PM Sep 4th from web
2/3/93: I could also swear Tweezer had a vocal tease of the Macarena, but wiki sez it wasn’t popular until ‘96. #phish = psychic?!?3:29 PM Sep 4th from web
2/3/93: Bowie and Tweezer are the big jams; Bowie starts strong and fizzles, Tweezer is gnarlier/better, but ends in a WTF “Horse” segue.3:28 PM Sep 4th from web
2/3/93: Fishman plays the trombone in “I Didn’t Know” - somehow it’s even worse than a vacuum solo. #phish2:16 PM Sep 4th from web
2/3/93: first Wedge too (Rift was released the week before this show), and with a great, tight jam showcasing Page’s new ivorys.2:00 PM Sep 4th from web
First on the #phish docket: 2/3/93 Portland Expo, Portland, ME. Page calls fans to the post on his new piano, before the first Loving Cup.
