4/12/93 - IOWA CITY, IA
Threaded throughout the day will be #phish project, Show 47: 4/12/93, Iowa City, IA, IMU Ballroom. Man, this was a long tour.
4/12/93: Speaking of a long tour, Golgi is fiercely bungled. But they follow up with the only Tube of 93! Jam is a Suzy-esque Page solo.
4/12/93: Decent Stash, but not as cool as the string quintet version from last night (http://j.mp/a4RiRo) [HT @YEMblog] #stopsingingalong
4/12/93: Trey’s telling a story about his dentist great-grandfather, an Iowa grad, while the band vamps Ellington’s Satin Doll.
4/12/93: “He was the first dentist ever to use nitrous oxide in this state” <wild cheers> “Very popular guy.” #treytalks
4/12/93: I think the secret to a good Antelope is when you feel like the 2nd section might never end. This gets there for a couple minutes.
4/12/93: Some big time majestic chords to launch the Tweezer jam, but then it diverts into an atonal dead end (like a lot of 93s, oddly).
4/12/93: This YEM randomly became Gumbo for a minute. Must have been something they were working on in soundcheck?
4/12/93: And now it’s Honky Tonk Woman, thanks to Mike’s bass solo. Lotta Stones lately. And now New York, New York vocal jam. ADD-YEM.
4/12/93: In a Gadda Da Vida jam in the middle of Fish’s vacuum solo makes it slightly less intolerable.
4/12/93 verdict: Lots of bustouts in this show (Tube, Gumbo, Highway 2 Hell) at a time when there was less history to bustout. OK otherwise.
