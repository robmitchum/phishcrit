  5/8/94 - BEE CAVE, TX
  Huddle for warmth with 5/8/94, Bee Cave, TX, The Backyard. Bee Cave, TX? That can’t be real, right? http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-08/ …
  5/8/94: Bee Cave is a town 12 miles west of Austin with pop. 3,925. They couldn’t find a venue in Austin?
  5/8/94: I wonder if there was a lot of…buzz about these shows. #TipYourWaitress
  RT ‏@therealburnham Tiny little suburb of Austin and its only claim to fame is the Backyard. Also, the Backyard is one of the worst venues ever.
  5/8/94: How will they follow up breaking all the rules at the Bomb Factory? With a Jim > Foam opener, of course.
  5/8/94: More standard fare with Axilla II and Rift. This show better pick up, or you’re gonna hear a lot more bee puns.
  5/8/94: The DWD intro is getting a little longer and noisier, solo feels vaguely Auld Lang Syne-y to these January ears.
  5/8/94: Stash jam starts out with a flurry of Cannonball teases, the first nod to last night, then stays on track save a couple DEG-y parts.
  5/8/94: Page Side 4eva, but he does do an awful lot of samey arpeggiated runs in these early 94 Coil solos. Teases the end of BBJ here.
  5/8/94: Welcome back 2001, which has been strangely absent for 14 shows — the longest gap it will ever see (though it’s currently at 8).
  5/8/94: The DDL pedal finally allows Trey to realize his dream of a duet with himself in the Antelope intro.
  5/8/94: Really enjoy the shape of this Antelope jam. Trey stuck in a locked groove, melodies bubbling up from Mike, stop-starts.
  5/8/94: Man, they are pushing it hard too, past a few obvious exit points. Guess a little Bomb Factory magic did carry over after all.
  5/8/94: The tempo of this Antelope keeps ramping up, Fish basically punk rock status by the time the 2nd segment finally breaks.
  5/8/94: I’m not sure I buy that the melody doodle in the 3rd segment of Antelope is “Mystery Achievement,” but it’s nice, whatever it is.
  5/8/94: It’s Ice breakdown mostly a feverish conversation between Page piano and Trey wah, with a brief flash of Magilla.
  5/8/94: Trey has been futzing around with what sounds like a reggaeton air horn, at the end of Antelope and throughout Fee.
  5/8/94: Bendy Fee mini-jam slinks into Julius, which is standard but for a brief Buried Alive lick near the end of the solo.
  5/8/94: Well hey, a Theme From Shaft quote in YEM, 19 months before Albany! Not nearly as transcendent a version, but pretty chillaxed.
  5/8/94: The vocal jam is back after missing the last 2 YEMs, so forget that rumor I was trying to start. It even segues into Halley’s.

  5/8/94 Final: Not much carryover from the prev night, except for an insane Antelope & a patient YEM. Two steps forward, 3/4s of a step back.
