4/21/93 - COLUMBUS, OH
OK, special snow day edition #phish project - show 54: 4/21/93, Columbus, OH, Newport Music Hall. A significant jam within.
4/21/93: Appropriately enough, the show opens with Buried Alive. #jesusblizzard
4/21/93: Foam continues my own personal Snow Day theme here - though it seems to have finally stopped getting thicker outside.
4/21/93: Not much improv to speak of yet, but the band is blistering through composed parts and Maze. Got a good night’s rest in CLB.
4/21/93: Forbin narration: gremlins sand down the venue’s edges (great sound fx) into a silver ball, country becomes a labyrinth game…
4/21/93: …venue-ball falls through hole, floats through space, lands on Gamehendge.
4/21/93: Lots of these ‘93 Forbins involve the venue morphing & traveling somewhere. Travel dreams represent “journeys through life.” Hmmm
4/21/93: For all the exciting glimpses of the future, the core sound of ‘93 Phish is sprinting through Rift and PYITE at 300mph.
4/21/93: Well hello there, this Antelope instantly turns a recital-style show into a noisy thrill ride, finding lots of dark side paths.
4/21/93: Wow, key and tempo changes signaled with the “secret language” trill (one by Mike). Haven’t heard that before, I think.
4/21/93: Some of that Antelope fire survived setbreak to ignite the Possum opener; ultimately contained, but has its raucous moments.
4/21/93: OK here we go - the “Demand” Melt that appears at the end of Hoist. A rare 2nd setter, only the 4th of this looong tour.
4/21/93: Again, the golden sign that a strong jam is forming - Trey is already spitting out ideas before they leave the vocals.
4/21/93: This Melt is very un-‘93 - band fitting together like puzzle pieces, slowly evolving, instead of raging at high speed.
4/21/93: Everyone knows their role - Trey gradually unravels as Mike tightens up, Page is subliminally effective, Fish is the reference pt.
4/21/93: And damn if it doesn’t know just when to end. At only 12min, it’s not unusually long for ‘93. Big ovation follows.
4/21/93: So yeah, a great Melt, easy to see why it is band-approved. Really quickens the pulse. #betterthancoffee
4/21/93: Guess they needed a break after that Melt, because an oddly-placed Coil follows. Bit more full-band jamming than usual before Page.
4/21/93: Even Big Ball Jam has a little extra pep in this show. Good work, Columbus.
4/21/93: Mike’s jam has a blink of a Oye Como Va tease, gets very close to the Simple riff, then gets weird and noisy.
4/21/93: Another great ‘93 Weekapaug, but old-school jamming style (near-silent breakdown, machine gun peak) feels a bit dated after Melt.
4/21/93: Instead of 2nd Weekapaug verse, a weird, awkward segue into Gumbo, which still has the Freebird ending; good way to end set.
4/21/93 verdict: The Melt is a milestone for a reason, and sounds even more groundbreaking in context. The rest is avg, esp liked the ‘Lope.
