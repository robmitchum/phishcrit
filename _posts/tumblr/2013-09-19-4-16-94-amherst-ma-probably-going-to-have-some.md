  4/16/94 - AMHERST, MA
  Probably going to have some interruptions during this, but: 4/16/94, Amherst, MA, Mullins Center at UMass. It’s educational!
  4/16/94: The return to boomy arena sound after the pristine Beacon acoustics is very apparent on this AUD and its bass-y Jim opener.
  4/16/94: Fee’s microjam would’ve made an excellent segue into NICU, which stays in setlist limbo. Instead, inferior Axilla II lyrics debut.
  4/16/94: Weird, choppy riff by Trey at the onset of the Stash jam takes them right off the track. Mike quickly echoes and develops.
  4/16/94: Stash headed for sunnier climes, but abruptly steered into a quiet roar and deftly swelled back into a normal ending. Nice.
  4/16/94: Nellie Kane’s bipolar acoustic/electric status goes to the plugged side this time, and the riff blends naturally into Antelope.
  4/16/94: Extra high tempo section in the middle of this Antelope hints that the band is challenging the song/itself like it’s Aug 93 again.
  4/16/94: (It was so 93-ish I made a typo on the date)
  4/16/94: After a more experimental than usual first set, the second starts with Sample and Poor Heart. Tweezer to the rescue?
  4/16/94: Tweezer still a hard-driving clockwork, a sampler of interlocking riffs until the slow ending, which is extended and a bit playful.
  4/16/94: Fun how AUD quirks can highlight aspects of songs you’ve heard 1000 times. Ex: feeling the Mike/Fish latin shuffle in this Lizards.
  4/16/94: Good news, everybody — Julius has settled into its momentum-killing role already!
  4/16/94: First Vibration of Life in nearly a year crashes the YEM ambient section. I’m no metronome, but it feels a little faster this time.
  4/16/94: Brad Sands gets a second chance on the YEM tramps after his NH debacle. From the crowd noise, sounds like he improved.
  4/16/94: The YEM jam seemed to verge on DEG territory for a while, but as previously disclosed, I don’t have the best ear for it.
  4/16/94: Well look at Page with the Led Zeppelin “Thank You” teases in his Coil solo. Starts at 5:26. (cc @bizarchive)
  4/16/94: Huh, Tweeprise after Coil, pre-encore. So the other three just stood awkwardly at the side of the stage during the solo?

  4/16/94 Final: First set’s promise doesn’t find purchase in second, but they sound looser now that the big Beacon run is behind them.
