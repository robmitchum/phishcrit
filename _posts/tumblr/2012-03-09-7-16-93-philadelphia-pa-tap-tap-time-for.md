7/16/93 - PHILADELPHIA, PA
Tap tap. Time for 7/16/93, Philadelphia, PA, The Mann Center for the Performing Arts. Fancy!

7/16/93: Two Daniels in two shows. Always kinda sounds like they are singing “fuckfuck, fuckfuck” in the middle…

7/16/93: Straightforward “Myfe” ending to MFMF, hope the spookier codas aren’t done. Then Ya Mar declares summer tour officially open.

7/16/93: This kind of feels like a set of set openers so far, especially Buried Alive batting 5th. Little extra hot sauce on Trey’s solo.

7/16/93: 9 songs into the first set, and the longest song so far was a 7-min Ya Mar. Avg length: ~4.5 minutes. Songy! #jamshortage

7/16/93: Decent Antelope to close out a strangely brief (50min) set. Nellie Kane jam in first section, sloppiness adding tension throughout.

7/16/93: The first 2001! So cute in its infant form. Literally 8 seconds between peaks. Wish I could hear the crowd reaction better.

7/16/93: 2001 lead-in gives Melt a little extra push, the band barely holds onto the merry-go-round bars through the jam (in a good way).

7/16/93: Went to a rock show and “Yerushalayim Shel Zahav” broke out. Little pitchy in its YEM-embedded debut.

7/16/93: In one show, Phish debuted covers of a jazz-fusion cover of Strauss, an Israeli song about the Six-Day War, and “Purple Rain.”

7/16/93: Happy to see Hood in the 2nd show of summer, hope it gets dusted off more this tour. Nice moments in intro and jam, OK peak.

7/16/93: Lotta nicknames in this show. The “Leo” in Llama might have just completed the set, joining Cactus, Big Red, and “The Purple One.”

7/16/93: Q: How many Summer 93 shows will it take before I stop finding Freebird amusing? Always laugh at “how ‘bout you biiiiiiird”

7/16/93 verdict: Songy set still feels like early tour jitters, but strong versions of Melt and Hood get the band out of their shell a bit.
