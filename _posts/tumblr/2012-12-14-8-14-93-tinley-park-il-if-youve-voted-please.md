  8/14/93 - TINLEY PARK, IL
  If you’ve voted, please join me for 8/14/93, Tinley Park, IL, World Music Theatre. The Chicago area’s worst live music venue for 20+ years.
  8/14/93: Fun fact - The World was the site of my first concert (Aerosmith/Megadeth) and my least favorite Phish show (8/8/97*).
  8/14/93: Just a dash of that Aug 93 unorthodoxy in Chalkdust and the Guelah intro. A more routine start for the bigger venue.
  8/14/93: A little extra ambient DivSky doodling from Trey, who seems to be practicing for when he adds the DDL to his rig in ‘94.
  8/14/93: Nasty feedback in The Horse, just to remind us that they’re playing at the shitty shitty World Music Theatre.
  8/14/93: Nice lengthy dark breakdown in It’s Ice, Wilson-ish chords skating off into a Nutcracker tease from Page.
  8/14/93: After a successful year, Melt is officially up to every-other-show status. Tonight’s jumps immediately into a Miss You-esque jam.
  8/14/93: (Miss You perhaps being a reference to Sugar Blue, who they played with 4/10/93 at the Aragon [and would again 8/8/97])
  8/14/93: Mike continues his teasing mood with some Linus & Lucy. Generally harder rocking and more segmented than your typical ‘93 Melt.
  8/14/93: You know it’s August 93 when even Poor Heart goes off script with a near-silent jam.
  8/14/93: First time a 2001 has dropped into Antelope…not really the most triumphant of segues.
  8/14/93: Antelope so far off the beaten path it’s being stalked by the Blair Witch. Jumping from theme to theme (maybe too quickly).
  8/14/93: But when it finally settles into a Who pastiche a few minutes before the Sparks segue, that’s the good stuff, man.
  8/14/93: Sparks -> Walk Away works so well, classic rock stations should take note.
  8/14/93: If you’ve ever been to Tinley Park, the “Tinley Park Jam” is appropriately nightmareish. The sound of the suburbs.
  8/14/93: Funny how Walk Away and Have Mercy seem to cluster in big seguefest shows.
  8/14/93: About a half hour between the start of Antelope and it finally reaches the end. Quite the (amazing) journey.
  8/14/93: I’m going to excuse this particular mid-set Coil since they probably all needed a break after the Antelope mayhem.
  8/14/93: Haha, preseason Bears game score update from Trey mid-Daniel.
  8/14/93: YEM returns to the abstract, quicksilver jamming that made up a lot of the Super-Antelope. A new style is taking shape.
  8/14/93: Is this a Smoke on the Water tease or a Cat Scratch Fever tease?
  8/14/93: I’m going to need to revisit that YEM to try and find the “Kool Thing” tease that @phishnet says is there.
  8/14/93: So in this set we have Strauss, The Who, James Gang, The Mighty Diamonds, Deep Purple, The Pretenders, Sonic Youth, and Prince.
  8/14/93: …and go ahead and add ZZ Top to the list with the encore. Just your typical band repertoire.
  8/14/93 verdict: A tease/seguefest in the same class as 2/20 or 3/14, but the improv between the hijinks is even more curious and prophetic.
