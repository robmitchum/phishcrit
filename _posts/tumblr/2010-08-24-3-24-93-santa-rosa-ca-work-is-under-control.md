3/24/93 - SANTA ROSA, CA

Work is under control, so I’m finally able to resume #phish project. Show 35: 3/24/93, Santa Rosa, CA, Luther Burbank Center for the Arts May 18, 2010 11:48:20 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Band sounds as rusty as I am at reviewing them. Llama, Foam, Fee, Poor Heart - the batting practice of ‘93 Phish. May 18, 2010 12:07:36 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/24/93: Wow, venue namesake Luther Burbank was a famed botanist who invented a potato breed used for McDonald’s fries: http://bit.ly/aa54z3 May 18, 2010 12:17:39 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Sample appears to have reached its mature form in its 7th performance. Now it will remain exactly the same for the next 17+ years. May 18, 2010 12:25:29 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/24/93: After intermitting, the second set makes a promise with Landlady > Split that it can’t keep. Melt is frustratingly scattered. May 18, 2010 1:35:05 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Some wiggle room in Tweezer, wild octave pedal jamming at the jump morphs into atonal nightmare. No happy melodic ending. May 18, 2010 1:55:20 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Band comes in 1 at a time on YEM intro - a flub with benefits. Crowd is silent during ambient stretch, except for 1 dude clapping. May 18, 2010 2:17:28 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Standard gooey YEM w/ “Under Pressure” vocal jam a nice mellow respite, then gets into evil pirates and subliminal whispers. Scary. May 18, 2010 2:36:54 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93: Special guest “Sam” on stage to tell the Prison Joke. #ratedmformature May 18, 2010 2:54:22 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/24/93: Lot of evil spirits in this show, but at least they sent people home with a calmly ruminating Page Coil solo. May 18, 2010 3:28:58 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/24/93 verdict: In sunny SoCal, about as dark as an early 90s show can get. Is the prison joke the cause or result of bad vibes? #phish May 18, 2010 3:32:48 PM CDT via TweetDeck
