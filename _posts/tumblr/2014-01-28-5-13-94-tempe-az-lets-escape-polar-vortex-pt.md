  5/13/94 - TEMPE, AZ
  Let’s escape Polar Vortex Pt. 2 and winter in the southwest with 5/13/94, Tempe, AZ, Hayden Square.  http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-13 …
  5/13/94: Can’t find much Google intel on Hayden Square, which appears to be condos nowadays. @shapsio notes say it was outdoors, 1500 cap.
  5/13/94: Eerie that they play It’s Ice whenever extreme cold forces me to work from home, but they played Ice every other show in 94, so.
  5/13/94: Extended, busy Ice breakdown, with Trey trying out Hendrixy wah-grunge over the other 3’s Latin jazz. It works and it doesn’t.
  5/13/94: One side effect of Hoist/radio-friendliness I don’t think I’ve commented on — their live vocals sound very good in early 94.
  5/13/94: Stash proceeds according to type until about the 9:45 mark, when Trey uses that grunge-wah again to pry open the gates of hell.
  5/13/94: A little taste of the old-school longer ending to MFMF, creepy Pink Panther-ish noodling around the myfes.
  5/13/94: A Slave that doesn’t so much build as leap from subtle, chiming harmonics to a power-chord fist-pumping conclusion.
  5/13/94: Page throws a couple Layla teases into his Suzy piano solo, but it’s the dumb part of Layla, not the good part.
  5/13/94: Was there ever a point where the setbreaks actually were 15 minutes?
  5/13/94: The momentum of a pleasingly sideways Chalkdust opener is immediately squashed with Bouncin’. 2nd sets just can’t catch a foothold.
  5/13/94: Melt is an angry squall, most notably during the perseverative crest from 7:20-8:00. More crunchy Trey tone in spots.
  5/13/94: Some of Melt’s savagery bleeds into McGrupp, which drives through the composed part into an unusually collaborative Page solo.
  5/13/94: This run of Melt > McGrupp > Peaches > Mule is just a wonderfully weird example of Phish logic.
  5/13/94: A little bit of Providence Bowie-style creepy whistling over the ambient section of YEM.
  5/13/94: @phishnet says that was a Mind Left Body jam in the YEM, so I guess I’ll buy it. Good 2-show run for elusive, vague jamband themes.
  5/13/94: Don’t think I’m up to the task myself, but I’d love to see someone write about the evolution of the YEM vocal jam.
  5/13/94: A crowd-pleasing hit parade to end the show, with Prince, Zeppelin and Skynyrd floats. Though 2 of 3 are not exactly normal covers.
  5/13/94 Final: Not many memorable moments, but song choice keeps the 2nd set fresh and almost flowing. A spring thaw still in progress.
  A 5/13/94 PS, some good venue info in this @phishnet comment: http://phish.net/reviews/permalink.php?commentid=1336474469 …
