3/9/93 verdict: Technical difficulties aside, this was a humdrum show that turned fascinating in the 2nd set. Band must be comfy in CO.3:36 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: We’re missing the last 4 songs. Bummer, no “a cappella rendition of The Eleven by a tenor in the front of the balcony” in encore.3:34 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Vacuum solo getting into some dog-only frequencies and theremin territory here.3:27 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Another solid Weekapaug, though not as good as the last 2. A couple minutes of ambient space give way to routine frenzy.3:07 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Hydrogen mangled by Trey, rest of band responds by going atonal themselves. Kind of a cool communication moment, if intentional.2:59 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Screwed up by more mp3 glitches at the end, but holy crap that was a good Reba. Gotta find a clean version.2:45 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Trey goes psycho on Reba vocals; but jam features a *much* more patient buildup than normal, capped w/ a gorgeous, loooong sustain.2:41 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Tweezer is starting to show some signs of the journey it will become, though still ends inevitably in Trey-wank and slowdown.2:28 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Axilla/Rift opening of second set portends higher energy, and Tweezer stands to benefit - band jumps right into proto-Julius jam.2:22 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Playful Antelope snaps set out of recipe-following rut; Latin-jazz teases, raging 2nd section, 4min of Makisupa-esque dub in 3rd.2:03 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: If the Phishometer has “composition” on the left and “improvisation” on the right, the needle on this first set is hard left.1:36 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: Man these are some janky mp3s here. “Maze” just got stuck like a scratched record on “the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay.”1:04 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 
3/9/93: They must have learned something on 3/8, because the best Jim yet opens - then is engulfed by digital mp3 errors. Experimental!12:57 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck 

But we must soldier on for the palindromic #phish project show 25: 3/9/93, Colorado Springs, CO, Pike’s Peak Center.12:46 PM Feb 26th via TweetDeck
