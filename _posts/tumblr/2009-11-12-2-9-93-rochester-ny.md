2/9/93 verdict: With apologies to @adam42, that was the weakest 93 show I’ve heard so far, though the second set had its moments. 3/1012:38 PM Oct 1st from web 
Cool! RT @adam42 my 2nd show. bought tickets 2 days before and ended up 2nd row pit. trey acted out esther and gave me the puppet mic cover12:27 PM Oct 1st from web 
2/9/93: Fishman cuts short “Bike” for “Amazing Grace,” which I’ve heard in all but one show this tour. The downside of exhaustive coverage.12:23 PM Oct 1st from web 
2/9/93: Really cool segue from Stash to Lizards - Stash jam takes quiet turn, Trey arpeggiates his way into the next song smoothly.11:45 AM Oct 1st from web 
2/9/93: 2nd ever Sample sounding very normal amidst weird tunes like Weigh and My Sweet One…wonder if phans thought the sky was falling.11:28 AM Oct 1st from web 
2/9/93: The “hey”s are much more clipped on these old PYITEs. Segues into a nice, punchy Mike’s. Second set is looking better. #phish11:04 AM Oct 1st from web
2/9/93: First set is pretty blah here. “Wedge” is losing its stretched-out Page intro, “Esther” has tons of secret language cues.10:16 AM Oct 1st from web
