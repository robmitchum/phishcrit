7/24/93 - MANSFIELD, MA
Loading up 7/24/93, Mansfield, MA, Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts. The 2nd headlining debut at a classic #phish venue in a row.

7/24/93: Llama opener maintains the torrid pace of the previous show, though Horn to follow gets them back under the speed limit.

7/24/93: It’s sort of fun to hear amphitheater-sized responses in the Divided pause back before it became ritualized.

7/24/93: A couple back-to-backers (Nellie Kane, Rift) already in this set. Sorry to fans who made the 4-hour trip from Wantagh.

7/24/93: Wow, the Stash jam gets pretty out there. Gnarled chords & crash cymbals, then a quieter interlude of melodic Psycho stabs.

7/24/93: Fish false starts Bouncin’ before Trey audibles for the first Mango Song since ‘92 (150 shows). Relatively polished version.

7/24/93: Really nice couple minutes of pre-Page-solo jam in Coil spurred by Mike. Coil’s back in its proper end-set slot too.

7/24/93: Sixth consecutive 2001 benefits from this source’s deep Mike rumble. The drop into Melt doesn’t hurt either.

7/24/93: The Melt was typically blistering, the Fluff was typically long. Maze is another repeat, but one I’m looking forward to hearing.

7/24/93: A more standard Maze than the last couple gonzo versions, apart from some swell 2001 teases during Trey’s solo.

7/24/93: Weird 2nd Mike’s jam explores some interesting Type II ground, taking a leisurely stroll before beginning a spiraling chase.

7/24/93: Yerushalayim Shel Zahav makes its second appearance, its first in a Mike’s Groove. Hey, happy Passover y’all.

7/24/93: Weekapaug regains some of its spring hijinks - slow-down and blues segments keep things wacky. But the Mike’s half was better.

7/24/93: And Daniel is the FOURTH repeat from the previous night. The summer repertoire definitely seems strangely shallower than spring’s.

7/24/93 verdict: Rampant repeats aside, some promising glimmers of pure improv in Coil and Mike’s remind that August is nigh.
