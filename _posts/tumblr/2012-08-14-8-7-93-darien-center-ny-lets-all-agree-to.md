8/7/93 - DARIEN CENTER, NY
Let’s all agree to disagree and enjoy 8/7/93, Darien Center, NY, Darien Lake Performing Arts Center. Fans in ‘93 ask “what is web-cast??” 

RT @ericwyman @phishcrit but they all skipped Cincy and are super pissed. 

8/7/93: Yeah buddy, Llama opener, better than afternoon coffee. Deranged electrocution-style soloing from Trey. 

8/7/93: Bouncin > Poor Heart is a good time to mention that this is their first show at DLPAC, which I pronounced “dillpack” in my head. 

8/7/93: Dillpack ‘97 had the Pranksters, ‘00 had the sick Drowned > Crosseyed, ‘09 had, um…How High the Moon? 

8/7/93: Woah, this is new territory for Stash. Happy theme (major key?) slowly turns creepy, completely off the usual jam structure. 

8/7/93: And then a perfect dismount into Makisupa. That was one of the first Stashs that could have gone 20 minutes instead of 10. 

8/7/93: The band manages to chill out for about 30 seconds of ambient dub in this Makisupa. Some cool backwards effects near the end too. 

8/7/93: Oh man, Reba whistling over the Maze intro. These dudes are starting to get it. 

8/7/93: Stairway teases in Maze. \m/ 

8/7/93: Oh hey, the “Roller Coaster of the Mind” Forbin’s narration. Just heard this on FTA 16. Guess @shapsio is also in an Aug 93 mood. 

8/7/93: The narration accompaniment FX are top-notch. Fishman’s drums on the climb, the chaos of the descent, ambient space flight. 

8/7/93: Wow, that was really a no-filler set after Bouncin > Poor Heart. Is this the dawn of the quality first set era? 

8/7/93: Setbreak theory - amusement parks have the opposite effect of webcasts? #phishtheories #phishjokes 

8/7/93: All the darkness missing from the 1st set’s Stash was imported into this Mike’s, where even Page’s NY, NY teases are paranoid. 

8/7/93: “Irish Diddy Jam” does not feature Puff Daddy in a leprechaun outfit, to my chagrin. Weird interlude, w/ secret language. 

8/7/93: I’m glad they circled back to end Mike’s post-Kung…makes it 15min all together. 1st Mike’s > TMWSIY since the 2nd show of ‘93. 

8/7/93: Avenu > Sloth instead of looping back to TMWSIY. Segue worked shockingly well. Lots of “unfinished” business this show. 

8/7/93: A lot of fans sound relieved when Sparkle starts. Can’t entirely blame ‘em - that was a challenging, intense block of tunes. 

8/7/93: Hearing this evil circus music jam at the end of MFMF in a dark amusement park was probably pretty spooky. 

8/7/93: Is Fish playing Madonna washboard on this extended McGrupp Page solo? No show note. 

RT @neddyo @phishcrit yes, washboard solo during McGrupp! My fave version. 

8/7/93: In a show brimming with teases and segues and hijinks, it’s nice to hear just a solid, straightforward Antelope to close out Set II. 

8/7/93: Encore curveball with the only Carolina of the summer. Sucks for those who wanted to hear Freebird, but at least they got La Grange. 

8/7/93 verdict: Just keeps getting better - first complete two-setter in a long time with challenging improv, crafty segues & no lulls. 

RT @shapsio i’ve been in an aug 93 mood since aug 93 - @phishcrit - re: 8/7/93 on FTA 16 “guess @shapsio is also in an Aug 93 mood”
