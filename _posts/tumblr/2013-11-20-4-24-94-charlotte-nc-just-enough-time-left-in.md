  4/24/94 - CHARLOTTE, NC
  Just enough time left in the week for 4/24/94, Charlotte, NC, Grady Cole Center. Their fifth show in five nights. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-24 …
  4/24/94: Off to a very bipolar start with MFMF and Ya Mar. Cathedral-esque echoes on the backing vox, Mike lyrics flub.
  4/24/94: I wonder if I’ll get used to the Axilla II lyrics before they revert back to the original (which happened at my 2nd show!).
  4/24/94: Trey’s half of the Maze jam momentarily reaching nightmarish sheets of noise territory. Show status: darkish.
  4/24/94: This show is definitely lyrics optional. Maybe all the shows and sit-ins of the past week are adding up.
  4/24/94: Gin jam covers a LOT of territory. Blues strut, angry deconstruction of the riff, start/stop, soft jazzy landing w/ Jump Monk jam.
  4/24/94: The ADD style is still blooming, but that Gin might be as emblematic of its year as the Murat Gin is of Summer 93.
  4/24/94: And now a legit Ice breakdown keeps the first set adventurous. Some nice ideas by Page buttressed by scratchy rhythms from Trey.
  4/24/94: Whoa, hey there mysterious roar at the start of Slave to the Traffic Light. All sorts of weirdness infecting this set.
  4/24/94: That Slave was in attack mode instead of its usual stargazing beauty mode. I approve. Great first set, all around.
  4/24/94: Perhaps the “Tequila” tease that opens set 2 is a clue to the unhinged nature of this show?
  4/24/94: Tequila tease reprise got this Bowie off to a weird start, but hits upon a rolling horror theme in the 9th minute that’s…killer.
  4/24/94: Intense DEG segment gives way to a quieter stretch (vaguely Burning Down the House) and then more, more, more dissonance.
  4/24/94: Wow, big power chord segment starting in the 18th minute sounds like Tweeprise’s evil twin. And blammo, straight into the peak.
  4/24/94: Even Julius takes a slight dip into dissonance, before quickly reverting back to traditional wankage.
  4/24/94: Sure sounded like Page was teasing something (not Tequila) during his first Contact solo. Showtune? Latin? Not my expertise.
  4/24/94: One last DEG-esque tangle in GTBT, just for kicks. Then a curfew a capella encore.

  4/24/94 Final: A nasty tequila drunk, with 2 deep, dark jams in Gin and Bowie, and spiderwebs everywhere else. My favorite show yet in 94.
