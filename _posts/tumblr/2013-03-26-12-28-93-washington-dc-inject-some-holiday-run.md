  12/28/93 – WASHINGTON, DC
   Inject some holiday run spirit into your February doldrums. 12/28/93, Washington, DC, Bender Arena. Eat…my…shorts.

  12/28/93: Peaches is a helluva way to open an NYE run. The first one in 558 shows, and it’s a little wobbly for the comeback.
  12/28/93: Aha! RT @YEMblog: @phishcrit Cool way to honor FZ who died a few weeks earlier
  12/28/93: @YEMblog reminds me that this was the first show with the aquarium stage set: http://www.stage2pro.com/images/Phish_aquarium_set.jpg …
  12/28/93: (Secretly, I’ve always thought the aquarium set gimmick was kind of corny. Shhhhh)
  12/28/93: In an early Melt, Trey sneaks in a Peaches tease, then goes on the attack. Brief chaos in the middle, but mostly on script.
  12/28/93: Bender is on the small side (cap: 6,000) and maybe it’s just the tape, but the sound does feel more “arena” already.
  12/28/93: Sometimes Suzy Greenberg can be Phish at their grungiest. This version is sloppy in a good way, with some wild Fish fills.
  12/28/93: Feel-good summertime organ drones in a briskly-played wintertime Ya Mar. Everything feels a little keyed up this set.
  12/28/93: We have our first Auld Lang Syne tease roughly 40 minutes into the run.
  12/28/93: Yet another It’s Ice, though seasonally appropriate now and with some good full-band abandoned-circus creepiness in the middle.
  12/28/93: “The end was his road/His road was that road/So they say.”
  12/28/93: Long subdued stretch in this Possum, with maaaaaybe a Mind Left Body tease, then full blast into Kashmir, which was soundchecked.
  12/28/93: Fresh off recording Hoist, we get a Sample opener for Set II. It does sound considerably fuller than the summer versions, fwiw.
  12/28/93: Following up Sample with YEM is a good foreshadowing of the uneasy tension between commercial and experimental to come in 94.
  12/28/93: The YEM vocal jam wisely avoids riffing on the aquarium props, though does sound a bit like the sound of SCUBA diving.
  12/28/93: It’s possible that playing in an arena is bringing out the best in Fishman — he’s hitting everything harder, adding some edge.
  12/28/93: Previous comment inspired by MFMF, where as Malkmus once said, “those snares sound like shotguns.”
  12/28/93: Getting secondhand-nostalgic again for the time when FEFY was the go-to ballad break.
  12/28/93: Hood intros are getting longer and dubbier. Always loved these mini-jams, sad that they’ve kind of disappeared.
  12/28/93: The fact that they aren’t constantly tripping over each other in those Hood intros is some amazing, subtle band communication.
  12/28/93: Not sold on this Hood jam. Some nice quiet flutters early, but then took a rather aimless path to the peak.
  12/28/93: Per @neddyo’s weather report, I’m going to assume Highway to Hell (along with It’s Ice) was a commentary on the icy conditions.
  12/28/93 verdict: They sound really excited to be back on stage after 4 months off. Translates to high energy, low improv, pleasantly raw.
