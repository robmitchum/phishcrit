  5/22/94 - VANCOUVER, BC
  Canada’s Phish Stats, courtesy phish.net and ZZYZX
  Canada has seen 18 shows spanning 24 years of Phish’s career. After catching the band in 1989 on a rare venture out of New England, Canada didn’t see another show until late 1992, which started its most intense period of following the band. Over the next five years, Canada would see Phish 13 times on their climb to the top of the jamband heap. But like a lot of old school fans, the late 90s just didn’t do it for Canada. Sure, Canada caught a few shows in 1999 and 2000, but it just wasn’t the same. The 2.0 years came and went without catching Canada’s interest, and it wasn’t until 2013 that it gave them another shot – though even this reunion was star-crossed, with rainy weather forcing a postponement.
  The contours of Canada’s history with the band lead to some strange statistics. The “Most Common Not Seen” song for Canada is Possum, of all things, played nearly 500 times but never north of the border. Canada has never been blessed with a narration, having missed out on both Forbin’s > Mockingbird and Harpua. Mango, Gumbo, and late 90s staples such as Back on the Train, Velvet Sea, and Gotta Jibboo are also absent from Canada’s stats.
  As for what Canada has seen, it’s a pretty predictable list, with Chalk Dust (which has opened 4 of the 18 shows) and Rift on top at 10 plays each. You Enjoy Myself has appeared at exactly half of Canada’s shows, with Tweezer and Fish’s intro music just short of 50%. Canada has seen more than the expected amount of Glide, Nellie Kane, and Amazing Grace performances, and fewer Jims, Gins, and Bags than 18 shows would predict. However, Canada has caught the only known complete performance of “Immigrant Song,” (somehow performed a cappella), and Hot Rize’s “Midnight on the Highway,” the first appearance of “Misty Mountain Hop,” and a triple shot of Phish-by-way-of-TAB debuts on 9/9/99: Mozambique, The Inlaw Josie Wales, and First Tube.
  Was the excellent Disease on 7/22/13 enough to rekindle Canada’s fandom? Only time will tell. But Canada will always have warm memories of nights like this one, the third of five shows in Canada’s busiest year, a show that blends the Hoist and acoustic set regulars with 93-style jams in Melt and Tweezer and a healthy helping of the band’s proggier material.
  =====
  Speaking of USA vs. Canada, 5/22/94, Vancouver, BC, Vogue Theatre. The second dip north of the border this year.
  5/22/94: Things are a little weird up in Vancouver, so why not start off the show with Demand > Sloth, of all things?
  5/22/94: The Glide pause is a full 2-1/2 minutes. Before the end, Trey says they’re going to play “a number called ‘Whoomp There It Is’.”
  5/22/94: Phish’s arrangement of “Whoomp There It Is” sounds a lot like Peaches en Regalia.
  5/22/94: Trey and Mike organize miniature chase scenes in Melt, then they all contribute to a chugging assault. Densest version in a while.
  5/22/94: Divided Sky and Fluffhead in the same set, eh? Plus Glide, Peaches, Demand? This show is maximum prog so far.
  5/22/94: The band freshens up the acoustic catalog with My Sweet One, complete with Page melodica solo!
  5/22/94: Trey, Pre-DFB: “Greasy Fizeek is going to penetrate your very hearts and souls with an emotion solo. Be prepared to weep openly.”
  5/22/94: Disease in its now-standard second set opener role for the first time since…its first complete performance on 4/4.
  5/22/94: Trey sits back and plays rhythm for a good spell of the Disease jam, unusual for these early days of the song.
  5/22/94: After my essay the other day on disorder in It’s Ice, this one is less chaotic. Intermittent drumming from Fish keeps it weird.
  5/22/94: Very quiet, soothing middle to McGrupp. Kind of the mellow twin to the It’s Ice jam in some ways.
  5/22/94: Some nice breakdowns in the composed part of Tweezer. Old-fashioned jam gradually deconstructs to a choppy section w/ Wedge drums?
  5/22/94: Some missing/late “Slaaaaaave”s in Slave, which is disorienting. Jam starts in silence before the usual prayerful build.
  5/22/94: They don’t save Tweeprise for the encore, so only three songs between Tweezer proper and the ‘prise. Monkey encore.

  5/22/94 Final: A composition-heavy show in British Columbia still leaves space for interesting but old-school jams in Melt and Tweezer.
