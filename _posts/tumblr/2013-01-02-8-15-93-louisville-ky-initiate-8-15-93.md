  8/15/93 - LOUISVILLE, KY
  Initiate 8/15/93, Louisville, KY, The Macauley Theater. Let’s see what they have left in the tank for the Sunday show of a historic weekend.
  8/15/93: An ominous beginning with the first ever Sample opener, and a sloooooww version to boot.
  8/15/93: First off-script moment of the show is a dark, 2001-ish bleed from ATR into Caravan. Also ominous, but in a better sense.
  8/15/93: Very open Caravan, shame that we won’t hear it again for a while. A scuzzy AUD complements its prowl.
  8/15/93: Interesting quiet, fluttery segment in the middle of the Jim jam, deft overlapping from all four players.
  8/15/93: Eternal hoorays for Fee outro jams. Squeaks from Trey over piano tinkles and cartoony bass.
  8/15/93: The makings of an epic Stash - starts out with Mike in the cockpit while Trey and Page make siren noises.
  8/15/93: Stash resolves quickly to a more melodic and braided segment aptly described as TMWSIY-ish by co-pilot @misterajp.
  8/15/93: Definitely the happiest Stash 93 has seen in a while. Though it’s steering into a rather haunted segment for the homestretch…
  8/15/93: Forbin’s narration is again very Maharishi Trey. “You’ve got to get out to get in,” squeezing out the tension…climbing up a nose?
  8/15/93: Now the narration is very Fantastic Voyage (the movie, not Coolio), and also very gross.
  8/15/93: No 2001 to start second set; Rift instead. An underappreciated set opener.
  8/15/93: Tweezer trying to do the multiple section thing, but keeps drifting back to classic rock power chords (incl. Cocaine).
  8/15/93: The band finds a non-classic-rock channel about 10 minutes in: demented dub briefly visited by Simpsons signals and Tweezer riffs.
  8/15/93: Caravan went so well in the first set they come back to the jazz well for The Landlady. Small(er) venue effect?
  8/15/93: A very good Maze that, like a lot of very good Mazes, succeeds in a way that is difficult to explain. Just off-kilter enough.
  8/15/93: Can already tell that the no-mics portion of this set is going to be pretty hard on the tapers (and listeners on headphones).
  8/15/93: So much shushing. RT @tfaz: @phishcrit The intermittent shushing really paints a picture.
  8/15/93: That very faint sound I’m hearing amid the shush and yell war is the first time Nellie Kane has been played acoustic.
  8/15/93: If you were a Phish fan in 93 you were either a yeller or a shusher (or during Freebird, a giggler).
  8/15/93: Hood encore is standard pulsing beauty until a brief, mid-air-float in the 10th minute recharges for the final drive to the peak.
  8/15/93 verdict: A solid sleeper show with deep, mood-swing jams in Stash and Tweezer and a double dose of Phish-jazz. Shuuuuuuuush.
