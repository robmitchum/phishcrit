4/24/93 - POTSDAM, NY
…time for #phish project show 57: 4/24/93, Potsdam, NY, Cheel Arena. Another tiny NY college. No conflicts of interest.
4/24/93: Both Chalkdust and Guelah feature a little bit of extraneous doodling in the intros. Bodes well for the rest of the show?
4/24/93: Trey trills the F out of the first half of the Stash jam, pleasingly Middle-Eastern. Back nine is noisier, peaks hard.
4/24/93: Jeez, a lot of these ‘93 Horses feature “guitar bro showing off for girls at a party” acoustic diddling.
4/24/93: Wow, killer brief Rift > Caravan segue, Trey sustain drone as they settle into the rhythm.
4/24/93: Pretty random cover of Sam & Dave’s “When Something is Wrong with My Baby.” Everyone takes a turns on vox, laying it on thick.
4/24/93: Uh oh, people getting crushed up front, Trey advises “be cool.” Reminds me of “Step Back,” my favorite 5/8/77 Dead cut.
4/24/93: Hey, it’s the rare “Aw fuck” secret language, in the Antelope intro. More trillin’ and killin’ in the jam. Tense, blazing.
4/24/93: Llama, Foam is a very first set way to open up this second set. Then a rare Gin (1st in 19) from the song’s “awkward phase.”
4/24/93: Very good, very long YEM (25min!) moves through several sections: long power chord jam, quiet funk, teases ahoy. It’s maturing.
4/24/93: Always wonder how much of the crowd left during these Fish vacuum solos, either out of fear or because it’s what they came to see.
4/24/93: Nice patience on this Harry Hood, and a solid machine-gunning climax. Sneak preview of its 94 heights?
4/24/93: Amazing Grace is the first one on mic in a while - didn’t trust those Clarkson University hooligans?
4/24/93 verdict: Nothing flashy, but some promising patience in the 2nd frame’s YEM and Hood. 5th show of a 6-nt run, so maybe tired = good.
