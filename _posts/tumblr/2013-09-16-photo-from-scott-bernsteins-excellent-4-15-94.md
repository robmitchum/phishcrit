  4/15/94 - NEW YORK, NY
  Like @YEMblog said: 4/15/94, New York, NY, Beacon Theatre. Join me and the NSA’s Jamband Surveillance Division: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-15 …
  4/15/94: Probably just the Llama opener talking, but this crowd/show already sounds 300% rowdier than the first two Beacon dates.
  4/15/94: First Paul & Silas of the year as the new acoustic bluegrass tunes steal its slot. Jump-segues into a shockingly early Hood.
  4/15/94: “Woahhh, love this!” “It’s like the Olympic rings!” #crowdchatter during Hood.
  4/15/94: The remarkable thing about ‘94 Hoods so far is the restrained patience, which was not really their strong suit at this stage.
  4/15/94: Great, off-kilter Chalkdust, with some stop-start stabs and Trey/Mike locking in on a creepy, descending riff before the solo.
  4/15/94: I always think they haven’t played Bouncin’ in a while, and it’s never true. I think my brain just filters it out somehow.
  4/15/94: It’s Ice breakdown is more busy than spacey, can’t settle on a direction. Fishman appears to have an all-cymbals policy for it.
  4/15/94: Disease closes out the set and is the first repeat of the Beacon run…back-to-back shows even.
  4/15/94: Maze opens Set II, and both Page and Trey’s segments do more creeping instead of shredding. Enjoyably evil.
  4/15/94: So of course they follow up that skin-crawling Maze with some If I Could heartstring pulls. It’s an emotional rainbow over here.
  4/15/94: The Giant Country Horns arrive to rapturous applause. I prefer Suzy as the start of a horns segment instead of the end/encore.
  4/15/94: I enjoy a horns set, but this one is very repetitious to 4/4/94. The hazards of experiencing a tour chronologically, I suppose.
  4/15/94: Oh good, the reverse jinx sorta worked. Alumni Blues jam in 4/4 Wolfman’s returns, but with vox this time, and a nice segue.
  4/15/94: Magilla in the encore (w/ a nice horns-only intro) makes it 8 repeats from 4/4. Buried Alive and Melt not repeated.

  4/15/94 Final: Solid 1st set sprinkled with improv, short 2nd set is tamed when the horns arrive. Still the most fun of the 3 Beacons.
