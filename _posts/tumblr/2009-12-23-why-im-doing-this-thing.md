Q: Why?
1) I now have a job that allows for extending listening time at work.
2) After a 9-year Phish hiatus, I relapsed hard in 2009.
3) Sites like phishows.com, the Google spreadsheet, Mr. Miner’s Audio Archive, the soundcheck/rarities spreadsheet, and so on make listening to old Phish shows easier than ever.
4) I often need something to tweet about, and this provides good fodder.
5) There is a lot of writing about Phish on the internets, some great, some not so. But nobody seemed to be just methodically revisiting old shows, certainly not on twitter. Maybe I’m wrong? I don’t know.
6) twitter allows for off-the-cuff live-listening reactions, and prevents me from wasting too much time on this silliness.
7) Make connections with other Phish fans and Phish-sympathizer music critics out there - and more and more seem to be coming out the woodwork.
8) Chart the path of Phish’s musical evolution. (this is why I started in 1993, which I’ll write more about later)
9) Learn how to use tumblr.
10) I like Phish. You should too! Give them a chance.
