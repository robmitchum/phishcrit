4/2/93 - BELLINGHAM, WA
In honor of NYE dates I probably also won’t get tickets for, #phish project show 42! 4/2/93, Bellingham, WA, Mt. Baker Theatre. 1:40 PM Sep 23rd via TweetDeck 
4/2/93: Still here, nothing exciting happening. Crazy that it’s only five years from this band here to the Island Tour. 2:04 PM Sep 23rd via TweetDeck 
4/2/93: So I guess Maze is the best we’re gonna get from this set, improv-wise. Hot version all the same, Trey doing a solid air raid siren. 2:36 PM Sep 23rd via TweetDeck
4/2/93: Second set so far in the same spirit as yawner first set. Most interesting thing thus far: flubbed Sample. 2:58 PM Sep 23rd via TweetDeck 
4/2/93: This show is so dull, I was forced to look up Bellingham, WA facts. Apparently it is “The Banana Belt of the Northwest.” 3:13 PM Sep 23rd via TweetDeck 
4/2/93: 75 percent of the way through the show, we have our first truly interesting moment in a minimal, eerie Weekapaug detour. September 23, 2010 3:40:13 PM CDT via TweetDeck
4/2/93: Even Fishman sounds tired, bored. Crowd still happy. In that crowd - a young Ben Gibbard! Actually no, probably not. September 23, 2010 4:01:22 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
4/2/93 verdict: Well, they can’t all be winners, and this one was The Mendoza Line of #phish shows. September 23, 2010 4:23:46 PM CDT via TweetDeck
