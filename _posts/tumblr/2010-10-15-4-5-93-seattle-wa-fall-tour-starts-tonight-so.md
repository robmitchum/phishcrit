4/5/93 - SEATTLE, WA
Fall tour starts tonight, so only logical to do #phish project show 44: 4/5/93, Seattle, WA, HUB Ballroom. Previous: http://bit.ly/d08exd
4/5/93: Off to a good start with an extended “Caravan” quote woven into Llama and It’s Ice in the two-hole.
4/5/93: Always startling to go back to ‘93 and hear just how fast some songs (Maze & Fluff here) are played. It’s like the tape is sped up.
4/5/93: Stash takes two separate excursions into the abyss before its natural peak; very patient, dark jamming for ‘93. #phish
4/5/93: That Stash jam was more haunted house than witch house, btw. #salemwho
4/5/93: Forbin storytime - everything on Earth turns to dust, then static on a TV. Someone changes the channel to a space hang glider.
4/5/93: Bowie more of a straightforward gallop than its cousin in darkness Stash, with almost a full secret language set in the intro.
4/5/93: First set tease blooms into second set bustout of Ellington’s “Caravan,” the first since ‘91 tour w/ horns (224 shows). It’s great!
4/5/93: Tweezer jam is sorta off-kilter; interesting, but not particularly fun to listen to. Evil Caravan jam towards the end though.
4/5/93: Setlist foul - two YEMs in two shows. The fact that they were in two different countries is no excuse, but the Yes teases help.
4/5/93: Post-YEM, second set feels rushed. Curfew? Trey dedicates Fire encore to the other guitarist in his high school band Space Antelope.
4/5/93 verdict: Second solid show in a row, even if 1st set out-shined 2nd. Go get Stash and Caravan.
