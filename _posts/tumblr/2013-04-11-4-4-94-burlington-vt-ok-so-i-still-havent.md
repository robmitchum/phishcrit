  4/4/94 - BURLINGTON, VT
  OK, so I still haven’t finished my 1993 wrap-up essay, but I can’t put this off any longer: 4/4/94, Burlington, VT, Flynn Theatre.
  4/4/94: Very excited that Phishtracks was born since I finished up 1993. Listen along with me here: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-04/divided-sky
  4/4/94: Quick “Back in My Hometown” a cappella (just like 7/16/94) before the year starts off with “Divided Sky.” Good opener choice.
  4/4/94: Hoist came out 5 days before this show, and the 1st track off of it is…Sample, of course. Now in its blandly mid-tempo mature form.
  4/4/94: First Hoist debut is Mule, forever ruining the SOAM shorthand for Melt. No Mule Duel yet, just a Page solo into klezmer.
  4/4/94: Maze, the original Trey/Page duel (or is that Foam?) sounds pretty sharp. Not hearing much rust on the band so far.
  4/4/94: No megaphone for Fee. Sellouts!
  4/4/94: Reba contains a very encouraging, if brief first jam of the year - swerves into a weirdly urgent section before the usual climb.
  4/4/94: It’s Ice continues its late 93 momentum with an extended break, exploring the Hey Bulldog riff and maybe A Little Less Conversation?
  4/4/94: Sorry 2001, set 2 starts with the first of many, many Diseases. Slowwww tempo, but Mike’s intro blows minds.
  4/4/94: I know I’m going to get real sick of Disease over the course of 94, but this one ain’t so bad. They’re clearly excited to play it.
  4/4/94: First If I Could is even better, despite some rough vox. Gorgeous volume pedal and sustain tricks in Trey’s solo.
  4/4/94: Enter the expanded six-piece Giant Country Horns. Mixing a “debut show” and a “horns show” — volatile.
  4/4/94: So many “woah-oh!” backing vocals on the Hoist songs that were later dropped: Disease, If I Could, Julius. #emophish
  4/4/94: Always thought the GCHs were superfluous for Melt. Self-conscious skronk distracts from the disorder in this version.
  4/4/94: OK Wolfman’s officially sounds the strangest in its debut. Trey singing lower, swankier tempo, brass slickness, Alumni jam?
  4/4/94: I’m going to read I Wanna Be Like You as subversive Fish commentary on the more serious direction of Hoist.
  4/4/94: I think it’s fair to call 1994 The Year of Hood, and the first one shimmers and blooms in all the right ways. Promising.
  4/4/94: Trey is “very happy to announce” the final score of the NCAA basketball final, which gets a big anti-Duke cheer from the crowd.
  4/4/94 Final: New songs and horns inject energy for the long haul to come. Improv still sounds 93-ish, but good Reba, Ice & Hood. 1994!
