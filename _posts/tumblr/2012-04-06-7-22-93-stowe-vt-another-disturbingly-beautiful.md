7/22/93 - STOWE, VT
Another disturbingly beautiful day of summer in March calls for 7/22/93, Stowe, VT, Stowe Performing Arts Center. Home field advantage.

7/22/93: Fun fact from phish dot com - “This show was played in a total downpour, soaking the band, the stage, and especially the audience.”

RT @YEMblog: Great clip of the soaking rains enveloping the stage in the 20th Anniversary Montage show in Boston

7/22/93: It must be raining hard, because they got out of sync in Foam, which they could play asleep/arms-tied/upside-down in ‘93.

7/22/93: Sample is already five months old, but still sounds super strange in the context of this era. Trey starting to extend the solo.

7/22/93: Another casualty of the rain - one of the shortest Divided pauses I’ve ever heard. ~10 seconds.

7/22/93: I guess the band could handle playing Mound w/o interruption during a little rainstorm back in these days (cf 6/15/11).

7/22/93: First real jamming opp in Stash yields a couple minutes of noisy Trey/Mike tangles over skittery drums. Almost DEG-ish.

7/22/93: Trey before setbreak: “We’ll try to make it a short break so you don’t have to sit in the cold.”

7/22/93: Set II extends the 2001 streak to 5. A wee bit spacier at the outset, still mere seconds (8 to be exact) between peaks.

7/22/93: Typically cacophonous Tweezer for the era, with a fake-out slow-down that diverts joyously to Walk Away (via PJ’s Alive?).

7/22/93: Few things make me happier than Page really sellin’ it on vocals.

7/22/93: A Tweezer-laced Possum, but I’m more into the patient little melody Trey and Mike tinker with immediately after the tease.

7/22/93: Gordon Stone on to play barely audible banjo for P & S, TMWSIY > Avenu > Rocky Top. Not too exciting, other than no TMWSIY return.

7/22/93 verdict: Impressive that they played a normalish show in squall conditions, but it’s a bit sloppy, rushed. OK Stash & Possum.
