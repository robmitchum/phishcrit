  6/9/94 - SALT LAKE CITY, UT

  I’m tempted to haul out all of my tour opener theories for this one, but just as treating 5/29 as a tour closer felt kind of forced, so too does this show feel like a false start of tour. The “spring” and “summer” tours are basically just 3-½ months of cross-country touring interrupted by a 10-day break, when the band presumably recharged their batteries on the west coast (or not?) before heading back east. The gap is closer to the time off between legs for most 3.0 summers, instead of a true demarcation point between tours.

  But there might still be something to say here about how the band shakes off the rust after time off, no matter how short. In the modern era, it’s self-evident that you are more likely to see a good show later in a tour than earlier. I think there’s also a lot of evidence that the longer the break between tours, the longer it takes for them to get back to peak performance — NYE runs tend to be better when there’s a fall tour, for instance.

  Of course, when I say “better,” I mean it in the typical Phish fan sense of “more and deeper jams.” And this relationship makes sense narratively: the more shows they play, the more they can refine their communication and comfort with each other until nearly telepathic improvisation arises. But there’s probably a less magical reason too, where the tedium of being on the road for several weeks together eventually leads them to experiment more to keep things interesting for themselves.

  So in some ways, the break between tours may not reset their improvisational skills, but rather refresh some of the simpler pleasure of just playing their songs tightly and well. Consider 2013, where the opening Bangor show was pretty subpar, but the nearly half-hour soundcheck jam is rightly acclaimed. There’s a sense that the progress over the course of a tour isn’t so much learning how to play together again as remembering how much they can get away with in front of a crowd.
  Here in Salt Lake City, the week-and-a-half off appears to have recharged their ability to blaze through largely composed songs such as Rift and Llama or the contained jams of Down With Disease and Suzy Greenberg. But it also seems to have reset the clock on their experimental tendencies, with safe, underwhelming versions of Melt and Mike’s that don’t carry over the momentum of the pleasantly surprising Laguna Seca Daze shows. Every Phish fan knows that the next round of slap-happy long-tour antics is only a week away, but for now, the 10-day vacation was a pause in real time, but a slight rewind in evolutionary time.

  The band & I both took a 10-day break, but we’re back on the road w/ 6/9/94, Salt Lake City, UT, Triad Amphitheater: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-06-09 …
  6/9/94: I figured they stayed on the west coast during their break, but @phishnet has Trey in Burlington on 6/3: http://phish.net/sideshows/guest-appearance/?d=1994-06-03 …
  6/9/94: They definitely sound refreshed on Llama and Rift, both played fast and furious. The spring’s “write it down” joke returns for DWD.
  6/9/94: Maaaaaaybe a little testing of the boundaries of the Disease jam in the 5th minute. An atypical solo for sure.
  6/9/94: New tour, same obsession with It’s Ice. Breakdown is still long, more direct than spacey, good piano vs. wah back and forth.
  6/9/94: Lots of Fish whoops in this Maze. Meanwhile, I found a cool newspaper ad for this show: http://golgiproject.com/files/phish/1994/1994-06-09gn.jpg …
  6/9/94: Lots of lyric flubs in Fee, and one insane note in Suzy. Clearly a set to get their feet back on the ground.
  6/9/94: A Q for set break…anyone got details on the Triad Amphitheater in SLC? Can’t find much online. Indoor? Outdoor? New name?
  6/9/94: Second set gets right down to business with Melt. Short, thorny, Stash-like jam, with lots of car-alarm tension from Trey.
  6/9/94: After an okay Glide > Julius, the 2nd Halley’s in two shows, this one with a weirdly tentative start.
  6/9/94: Nice quick double-time segue from Halley’s into Mule. Still not a proper duel, but more participation from Trey in Page’s solo.
  6/9/94: And we have the first hearing damage due to no-mics AUD of the summer tour. I would think an SLC crowd would be more polite.
  6/9/94: Sloppy second Mike’s jam suddenly gets a little more interesting when Trey goes briefly loop/drone-crazy in the 9th minute.
  6/9/94: Some good ideas bubble up in Weekapaug, but they’re moving too fast to explore any of them. It’s really regressed from ’93.
  6/9/94: The dude that almost broke my ears yelling for AC/DC during Ginseng gets his wish with a Highway to Hell encore.
  6/9/94 Final: A short, unremarkable show that just idles in the driveway to warm the engine back up after the brief break. Shrug.
