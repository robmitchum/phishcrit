3/19/93 - REDLANDS, CA   
Come for the baseball wonking, stay for the jambands. #phish project show 32! 3/19/93: Redlands, CA, The Greek Theatre. The other Greek. April 9, 2010 11:22:36 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: Snagged the soundcheck for this one - slow, loping Dog Log, then a 2x Get the Led Out w/ a T. Rex chaser. More #phish Bolan please. April 9, 2010 11:36:15 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: Into the show proper - fuzzy recording and Suzy > Llama opener give the proceedings a serrated edge from the get go. April 9, 2010 11:50:35 AM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/19/93: Shaping up as another Phish-for-beginners first set - Bouncin’ and Foam and Rift and Cavern. Stash to the rescue? April 9, 2010 12:11:10 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: Stash starts/ends conventional, but middle breaks down to cowbell solo, then silence, then a weird off-kilter minimalist jam. April 9, 2010 12:21:41 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: Back from setbreak. Another pro forma Jim, but followed by first It’s Ice of tour to explore deep space and Gershwin. April 9, 2010 2:08:13 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: This Uncle Pen lies in the gray zone between flubby and jammy, but Fishman’s square-dance instructions are a nice touch. April 9, 2010 2:13:49 PM CDT via TweetDeck  
3/19/93: Man, I’m so happy this project will allow me to hear every Sample ever played. #sarcasm #woofuckingsamplebrah April 9, 2010 2:17:54 PM CDT via TweetDeck  
3/19/93: Weekapaug (14min!) spends extended time in quiet mode - I suspect low-volume playing was one of the improv exercises this month. April 9, 2010 3:00:38 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93: Trey mentions before encore that this is the first outdoor show of the tour, making it the first outdoor #phish project show! April 9, 2010 3:31:41 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/19/93 verdict: If I had known it was an outdoor show, maybe…nah. Another routine, primer-style show. Very interesting ‘Paug though. April 9, 2010 3:58:07 PM CDT via TweetDeck
