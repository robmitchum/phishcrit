  5/26/94 - SAN FRANCISCO, CA
  On to night two. 5/26/94, San Francisco, CA, Warfield Theatre. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-26
  5/26/94: Night 1’s energy flagged towards the end, so opening with a Buried Alive > Poor Heart > Cavern suite is a good wake-up call.
  5/26/94: First Demand > Melt pairing since the Beacon. No car wreck sound effects, but lots of screaming.
  5/26/94: Melt jam gets interesting in the 8th minute when the drums drop out and Trey holds a looooong note. Pretty weird/shaky after that.
  5/26/94: First It’s Ice in 3 whole shows contains another piano vs. wah-pedal battle that never gels, but song ends in a Catapult duet.
  5/26/94: And we have our first repeat of the run, the second Sample in two nights. Sample. Why did it have to be Sample?
  5/26/94: Does this count as a Sample-prise? Is the entire Warfield run a Samplefest?
  Setbreak entertainment. RT @YEMblog: Video: Tom Scharpling vs. Phish — Running Late with Scott Rogowsky http://bit.ly/P1BA8s
  5/26/94: 2001 > Antelope to start the second frame. Just realized the last 5 2001s (all Set II openers, obv) have gone into Antelope.
  5/26/94: Less Trey lead/rhythm alternation in this Antelope vs. the 5/23 version I raved about the other day. More rhythm, actually.
  5/26/94: And they totally blow the peak — Trey’s still scraping noisy shrieks when the rest of the band chills out. It’s a fun mistake.
  5/26/94: Divided Sky and Fluffhead in the same show again, just like 5/22. At least they’re spread out in different sets this time.
  5/26/94: Weird…It’s Ice teases from Page and Trey around 10:15 in Fluffhead? cc @bizarchive
  5/26/94: Despite the Fluffhead, this set has much better flow than the previous night. Disease was a good mid-set energy boost.
  5/26/94: I jinxed the flow: acoustic set, Ginseng and Dog-Faced Boy, with the “emotion solo” bit again. Chronological listening ruins jokes.
  5/26/94: Lengthy quiet and restrained section in the YEM jam. Climbing 8-note pattern sprouts from it and takes us home.
  5/26/94: Cheers to the lady who shouted “Amen!” at the end of Amazing Grace.
  5/26/94 Final: Decent show with a quirky first set, but it feels like they’ve been playing it very *safe* lately, even on jam-friendly turf.
