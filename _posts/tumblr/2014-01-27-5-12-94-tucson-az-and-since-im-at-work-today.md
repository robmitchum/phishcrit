  5/12/94 - TUCSON, AZ
  And since I’m at work today, we’ll catapult right into 5/12/94, Tucson, AZ, Buena Vista Theater: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-12/ …
  5/12/94: Ya see, Catapult was a joke, because that’s the opener. Performed solo a cappella by Mike, who seems kind of embarrassed.
  5/12/94: Huh, that was only the fourth Catapult ever. Though that number will more than double in ’94.
  5/12/94: The scenic Buena Vista Theater: http://m5.i.pbase.com/o6/14/296714/1/92594995.HvVUmUNo.buena_vista.jpg … The band sounds re-energized after two days off in 3.
  5/12/94: Mike is very up front in this mix, which gives an unusual chance to hear what he was up to in this era. Early findings: rubbery.
  5/12/94: I think a lot about how Trey & Page’s equipment/effects pushed the sound, but Mike totally changed his tone over the late 90s too.
  5/12/94: Pretty standard Maze, though “pretty standard” now includes at least one murderous drone peak from Trey.
  5/12/94: Two quick, unusual loops to bleed over from Axilla II to Foam, as Trey finds more uses for his toy. Long “silent” jam in Foam.
  5/12/94: Throw in a nearly 60-second sustained note from Trey, and that’s one of the more off-model Foams you’ll hear.
  5/12/94: First Gin since the 4/24 version discussed on @hfpod. Trey screws up the exact same lyric.
  5/12/94: Much less frenzied than 4/24’s Gin. Jam and rhythm iterates but tempo stays steady. Some rare major-key DEG, pretty neat.
  5/12/94: “We’re going to take a break, let you guys get some air,” in case you were curious what it was like in the venue this night.
  5/12/94: Nearly a minute of abstract noise before the drums kick in on 2001. Finally seeing some stretch as it returns to the rotation?
  5/12/94: Melodic lead in the Antelope 2nd segment gives way to the usual shredding. 3rd segment follows some atypical, eerie chords.
  5/12/94: Looks like the acoustic guitar is gone from The Horse as well as MFMF…haven’t seen it in three versions now.
  5/12/94: 1st set had much better flow than this 2nd set, which is not unusual for early 94. Horse > Silent, bluegrass, Fluffhead?
  5/12/94: “Bring It On Home” lick in the middle of Fluffhead, just to make sure I’m paying attention.
  5/12/94: Lots more “Bring It On Home” in the Possum intro. Sounds more at home there than in Fluffhead.
  5/12/94: Fish must be feeling pretty Syd. After bringing back Bike on 5/6, here’s the first Love You since 8/8/93.
  5/12/94: Another pairing of Contact with BBFCFM. Why do they co-occur so frequently? (whyyy?) Just ‘cause they’re both Mike’s?
  5/12/94: So Set 1 opens with Catapult and Set 2 closes with BBFCFM. Pity the uninitiated.
  5/12/94 Final: Promising early, but steers towards novelty/variety like a lot of 93 “Intro to Phish”-style shows. Good tape sound though.
