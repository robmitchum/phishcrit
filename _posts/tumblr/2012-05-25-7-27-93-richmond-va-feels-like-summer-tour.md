7/27/93 - RICHMOND, VA
Feels like summer tour outside, so let’s do 7/27/93, Richmond, VA, Classic Amphitheater. Back on the HORDE tour for a quick one-setter.
7/27/93: Just because it’s a festival, doesn’t mean we stop the 2001 streak. Nine shows and counting. The DiMaggio streak of #phish.
7/27/93: 2001 crash lands into Rift. There’s a split second with the Rift riff over 2001 drums that sounds pretty nice though.
7/27/93: Stash jam starts out mad trilly, then duly performs its era-typical tension/release maneuvers in unexceptional fashion.
7/27/93: Another mid-set Coil in a HORDE set. Strange given the civilian-friendly nature of these setlists. Guess jamcrowds dig piano solos.
7/27/93: ~1 minute of space between end of It’s Ice and Purple Rain is the most interesting thing to happen thus far. Auto-pilot Phish.
7/27/93: Spoiler alert - sounds like some pretty elaborate pranking went down in this (v. sloppy) YEM: http://bit.ly/IMWVaR
7/27/93: My favorite line is “Making fun of Popper’s size (he was huge at the time)…”
7/27/93: Guest-overloaded YEM jam doesn’t quite repeat the nightmare of 5/5/93, though I could really do without the Poppering.
7/27/93: Ominous show note: “It’s possible there was supposed to be a second Phish set at this gig, but none was played.”
7/27/93 verdict: 2001 lights, check. Vacuum solo, check. Trampolines, check. Intro to Phish, check. Farewell to HORDE and good riddance.
