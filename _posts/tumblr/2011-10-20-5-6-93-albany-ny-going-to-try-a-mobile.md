5/6/93 - ALBANY, NY
Going to try a mobile #phishproject experiment this morning w/ show 66: 5/6/93, Albany, NY, Palace Theatre. Say hi to me on the #CTA.
5/6/93: I feel like there’s some potential for a Mound/Game of Thrones lot shirt.
5/6/93: Melt jam is pretty legit for this early in the show. Precise, focused, seething - everything that godawful ARU jam from 5/5 wasn’t.
5/6/93: Little Dracula laugh from Trey at the end of that Melt well deserved. #CHUDjam
5/6/93: Back up, with an ATR for a personal set re-opener. Nice quiet detour in the middle of a Llama almost too fast for them to sing.
5/6/93: This Possum is super playful, which is kinda what’s missing from most of the frequent 3.0 versions (Blossom Possum excepted)
5/6/93: Crazy storm moving in over Chicago - too bad I’m not hearing anything more threatening than Lawn Boy. yfrog.com/kl493wxj
5/6/93: Violin solo in Lawn Boy from guy they met on vacation in the Virgin Islands (Dick Solberg acc to @phishnet: http://bit.ly/oAuJkU)
RT @bourgwick @robmitchum 5/6 = my 1st tapes, bought (!) later in ‘93 from bootleg cassette vendor on st. mark’s place along with VU ‘68 boot.
5/6/93: Okay, old-timey bluegrass/country mini-set going well with the sheets of rain coming down outside, even if vox are a little cheese.
5/6/93: Trying to get over the “long songs = good jams” bias, but won’t deny being psyched to see “Tweezer - 19:44” pop up.
5/6/93: Couple moments (around 8min and 10min) that could have gone into the old “slowdown” ending, but pushed thru into some weirdness.
5/6/93: More distinct segments to this Tweezer jam than any I’ve heard in ‘93. Very predictive of 1994 style (and v. pretty around 16min)
5/6/93: Just peeked at the @phishnet setlist and saw that the Tweezer contained a “Crimes of the Mind” jam. Sorry, not a Dude of Life fan.
5/6/93: Another big jam in Mike’s - starts in a Wilsony place, flirts with Frankenstein, headbangs some more, than lands in…Obladi Oblada?
5/6/93: This is the kind of genre whirlwind they do better than anyone else - hard rock to Beatles-ska to hoedown in less than 5min.
5/6/93: I don’t think the violin guy knows how to play “Cracklin’ Rosie.” #bababababa
5/6/93: Only performance ever of “That’s Alright Mama” w/ guest dude on vox. Don’t remember the organ solo in the Elvis version.
5/6/93 verdict: 2 killer jams that hint at the future (Tweezer) & capture the present (Mike’s teasefest). Bluegrass guests OK, but overstay.
