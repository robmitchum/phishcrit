  12/31/93 - WORCESTER, MA
  Nearly 3.5 years after I started 1993, it’s time to finally put the year to bed: 12/31/93, Worcester, MA, Worcester Centrum Centre.
  12/31/93: Llama opener is a good way to saddle up that nervous NYE energy. First show at the now-DCU Center, capacity 15,000.
  12/31/93: Trey’s “everybody in yet?” in the Guelah pause brought me right back to listening to this tape in high school. #Proustian
  12/31/93: Trey’s extra plinky on the composed part of Stash. And the clapping is now officially A Thing.
  12/31/93: Intricate DEG-esque weaving at the outset of the Stash jam, nice stretch of tension, tension, release then a quiet finish.
  12/31/93: Extensive Roundabout tease from Trey before acoustic Ginseng. And I mean tease.
  RT @MelvinDisco worth mentioning that the WDCM FM sbd/aud matrix was the most preemo sounding source of any show for a looooong time
  12/31/93: More Plinko tricks in Reba, some 20 years before it would earn that name. Jam moves at a confident, communicative gallop.
  12/31/93: Neat, spirally detour around 4:00 in Antelope before returning to barely contained frenzy. This whole set is manic as hell.
  12/31/93: Not sure I agree with @TomMarshall111’s accent choice in his Antelope cameo though.
  12/31/93: Strangely, it’s been 12 shows since the last Tweezer, tied for the longest gap up to that point. It was almost MIA in Aug 93.
  12/31/93: Tweezer jam is like the old clockwork slowdown ending played faster and stretched. Disorienting, but breathtakingly intricate.
  12/31/93: Segue into Halley’s Comet gives us another Double Nancy for ‘93. Where’s his guest appearance?
  12/31/93: (Correction: I missed a 15-show Tweezer gap in 1992. But a dozen shows is still a long Tweezerless stretch for any era.)
  12/31/93: Woah! RT @dunhamrc: @phishcrit @dunhampl don’t forget the Banana Splits Theme tease in the middle of the Tweezer jam
  12/31/93: Some nice spookified Peaches licks in the breakdown to It’s Ice. Clearly, the official song of NYE Run 1993.
  12/31/93: The segues in this set are far more > than ->, but still good to hear a broader architecture forming vs. a collection of songs.
  12/31/93: This crowd loves to clap, man. The Possum intro is a downright hootenanny.
  12/31/93: This is a really weird and great Possum. Wind sprints interrupted by sparse conversations with audience noisemaker din.
  12/31/93: Pretty patient YEM given the hijinks about to unfold. Some minimal flourishes around the “Boy Man” and the start of the jam.
  12/31/93: Reading about the stunt, the tape must cut out a lot of the sound effects, save for the talking clam countdown.
  12/31/93: And I know it was needed for the music video, but the DWD sneak peek must have been a really confusing experience.
  12/31/93: A shaky theory that the song right after Auld Lang Syne is the band’s MVP choice for the year. Let’s cheat and say it’s Melt here.
  12/31/93: The Melt in question never goes out there, but is a great abstract of the era’s high speed, high precision interplay.
  12/31/93: Other than perhaps Ginseng & Lawn Boy, there hasn’t been a single breather in the setlist of this show. Pedal to the floor.
  12/31/93: OK, they finally found a song that won’t gracefully assimilate a Peaches tease, and it is Suzy.
  12/31/93: Surprised the Fish segment wasn’t one last Purple Rain for the year. I guess Fish has a no-repeats policy even if Phish doesn’t.
  12/31/93: Very pretty Hood, threading ALS through the jam. Not patient exactly (nothing is in this show) but deftly reaches its peak.
  12/31/93: Definitely feel like this is a Trey-dominant show. He’s been on point and in the lead throughout.
  12/31/93: Before encore, Trey acknowledges 10-year anniversary of the band. “Hope you guys will be back with us for 10 more.”#andthensome
  12/31/93: If it wasn’t for that AC/DC Bag encore on 5/8, all three ‘93 tours would have ended with Amazing Grace. Nice touch.
  12/31/93 verdict: If NYE shows summarize the preceding year, this one captured the deadly efficient spring more than the exploratory summer.
