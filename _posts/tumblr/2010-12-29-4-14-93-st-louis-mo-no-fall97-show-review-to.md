4/14/93 - ST. LOUIS, MO
No #fall97 show review to compete with today, so here begins #phish project show 49: 4/14/93, St. Louis, MO, American Theater. Go Cards.
4/14/93: Woah, pressure! RT @YEMblog: @robmitchum is about to start reviewing one of my favorite ‘93 shows.
4/14/93: High-energy start w/ Buried Alive, Poor Heart, Maze. Interesting that the band played this venue twice in four months (8/16/93).
4/14/93: This crowd is quite clappy. Must be carryover from being the best fans in baseball. #sorryronsanto #RIPthough
4/14/93: It’s Ice gets close to exploring the spacey middle part, but backs off. Always frustrating (esp after a 12/7/97 revisit).
4/14/93: Can tell from the first note that the Stash jam is going somewhere special (of course, I peeked…). Leaps right into the darkness.
4/14/93: The busy little jam under “Kung” is really nice, almost gives the chant a melody. Gets progressively more deranged, as it should.
4/14/93: Love the guy going “WOO-HOO-HOO-HOO” as they whip back into Stash. The advantages of an AUD.
4/14/93: OK, so this must be the best Horse ever, right? Kungprise, Pinball Wizard jam, Divided Sky tease. A bit over-stimulated here.
4/14/93: Set II opens with a marriage proposal from Roger of “just like Roger, he’s a crazy little kid” fame! Followed by AC/DC Bag, obvs.
4/14/93: “Woman From Tokyo” teases in AC/DC Bag…probably a reference to Roger’s new fiancee? #deeppurple
4/14/93: RT: @GuyForgetOPT: @robmitchum Check out Trey 5/7/99 Aftermath w/Roger @ American. The proposal is referenced: http://onlinephishtour.com/2010/11/07/aftermath/
4/14/93: This Tweezer is more “segmented” than the average early ‘93 version, foreshadowing of the next year’s multiple-theme megajams?
4/14/93: This YEM jam kind of flounders quietly before it drops into Spooky; a lot of bass-and-drums-and-nothing-else. Onstage antics?
4/14/93: Late-set Harpua! Narration is the normal story, but w/ Jetsons theme, The Doors, and poetry-slam delivery. Slap-happy fun.
4/14/93: I’m surprised Harpua > Runaway Jim doesn’t happen more often, ‘cause y’know “a dogggggggg”
4/14/93: No time for a Fishman song in that second set (thank god), so they throw him a brief Lengthwise to open the encore. #phew
4/14/93 verdict: Heavy on ‘93 wackiness (in a good way), w/ hints of “mature” jamming in Tweezer & Stash. Best show of this midwest jaunt?
