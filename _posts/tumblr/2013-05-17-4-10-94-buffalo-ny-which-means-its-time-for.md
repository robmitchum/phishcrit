  4/10/94 - BUFFALO, NY
  Which means it’s time for 4/10/94, Buffalo, NY, Alumni Arena @ SUNY Buffalo. Woke up this morning… http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-10 …
  4/10/94: Explains Trey’s “Oh Well” at the start. MT @YEMblog: “Fantastic Gig, Played Just After Trey Injured His Ankle.”
  4/10/94: No lower body injuries apparent during boisterous Jim. Was Trey on a stool or not? @phishnet debate: http://phish.net/reviews/permalink.php?commentid=1360792768 …
  4/10/94: It’s Ice breakdown stays earthbound, so no comparison to 4/8. But an interesting drum-less blues sketch regardless.
  4/10/94: The pace and energy of this show does not jibe with my experiences on painkillers. That must be some special rock band Vicodin.
  4/10/94: Mike keeps nudging the Melt jam towards the unknown, but it stubbornly stays mostly on track. Some good noisy tension though.
  RT ‏@lifftwit I remember it similarly. Leaning on stool @ points, but not sitting & not whole show.
  4/10/94: It’s possible that the set is heavy on uptempo numbers (Chalkdust, Mule, DWD) to keep Trey awake. Or it could just be 1994.
  4/10/94: If you’re going to play a show on a stool, might as well play some acoustic guitar. MFMF 2nd set opener.
  4/10/94: Some nice “quiet jamming” in Ya Mar. Less of an audience attention test, more of a compact idea swap.
  4/10/94: It’s really exciting to hear the moments in Antelope where the entire band decides simultaneously to take a hard turn.
  4/10/94: One such turn around 7:00 gets a couple minutes to bloom and warp into a horrorscape. Big, shreddy peak follows.
  4/10/94: Interesting Ginseng setup — standard electric except for Fish on washboard. Trey is starting to sound a little tired after Fluff.
  4/10/94: …but not so tired he can’t play drums on I Wanna Be Like You. “Playing with no foot, just his hands” Fish says.
  4/10/94: I think Fish’s voice acting is getting better with each I Wanna Be Like You.
  4/10/94: Gorgeous swells and sustained notes in this Hood jam, and a peak that just won’t stop. They’ve really found Hood’s sweet spot.
  4/10/94 Final: Never would’ve known Trey was injured by sound alone. Relentless energy, culminating in a spine-shivering Hood. Painkiller.
