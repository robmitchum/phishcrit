4/18/93 - ANN ARBOR, MI
4/18/93: Night 2 gets to the good stuff a little faster with a 3rd-song Melt; there’s an all-too-brief glimpse of unorthodoxy near the end.
4/18/93: Paul could put some serious echo into the soundboard back in the day. Noticed it on 4/17 Coil, and again here on Divided.
4/18/93: Quick, harmonics-heavy segue between Fee and Maze is boss, appropriately disorienting. Fish seems to be really feeling this Maze.
4/18/93: A 10-min I Didn’t Know? With fans reciting what they were thinking during the BBFCFM pauses the previous night. Lotta wooks.
4/18/93: Sample fan response: “I was tripping last night and I thought it was pretty fucking coooool.” #facepalm (cc @WookBuster)
4/18/93: Haha, Paul plays a snippet of Sex Pistols, Trey squeezes in a Fab Five dis, and Mike has the best answer of course. #BABYRACCOONS
4/18/93: Strange how Tweezer’s jam M.O. in ‘93 was to explore dissonance. Every version makes me very anxious. I wonder when it changes.
4/18/93: Signs we are in 1993 and not 2010 - tight versions of both Rift & Mound in this show. (Not that I care much ‘bout flubs, but ufda)
4/18/93: Proto-Simple gives way to playful improv in Mike’s, then a Low Rider jam, then Ya Mar - Trey & Page in tight tandem. #correction
4/18/93: And the show ends with Mike’s Un-Weekapauged. Like a sunrise without a sunset.
4/18/93 verdict: Like the previous night, memorable more for Phishy strangeness than musical highlights. Nice Mike’s, Possum though.
