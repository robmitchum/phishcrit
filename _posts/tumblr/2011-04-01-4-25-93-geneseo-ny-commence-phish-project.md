4/25/93 - GENESEO, NY
Commence #phish project: 4/25/93, Geneseo, NY, Kuhl Gym @ SUNY Geneseo. I guess this portion of the tour was the upstate NY college gym leg.
4/25/93: “Not another Possum” shifted to “Woah, Trey’s got something to say here” around minute 7 when he went all feedback drone.
4/25/93: Cheers to the spreadsheet (http://bit.ly/eLf670) for a really excellent AUD source on this one. Really feelin’ this wood block.
4/25/93: It’s Ice followed by Glide; saves the crew two trips on bringing out the Powerslides: http://youtu.be/3jTkf2Xg3AM
4/25/93: Experimental-for-the-era Jim, frantic and interlocking. About a minute where everything clicks, 4/21 Melt-style. #good
4/25/93: Forbin narration is kind of scientologish - spirits falling on crowd, controlled by Trey’s pedal board, “like a game of Tetris.”
4/25/93: Flubby Mockingbird reminds me that this is the 6th show in 6 nights for the band - a schedule that would likely kill them today.
4/25/93: Deep #phish knowledge - this I Didn’t Know references the lost “Guy Forget” verse also heard on 10/1/00: http://bit.ly/et0M8E
4/25/93: With both Wilson and The Curtain, this set opens twice. Strangely subdued drop from Curtain into Tweezer.
4/25/93: Percussive start to this Tweezer jam reminiscent of the “clockwork funk” from last NYE run. Kind of paints them into a corner tho.
4/25/93 (pardon the interruption): Very unique Mike’s, don’t think Trey played the proper riff even once in the intro/verses.
4/25/93: A busy multi-segment Mike’s is paired with a Weekapaug that spends a lot of time in quiet jam mode. Nothing too special.
4/25/93: A 2nd hack at “When Something is Wrong with My Baby.” Think it might have worked better if it was all Page vox instead of shared.
4/25/93 verdict: Gymnasium run closes out with a few moments of brilliance (Jim, Tweezer, Mike’s) and quirk, but the gas tank is low.
