  4/30/94 - ORLANDO, FL
  4/30/94, Orlando, FL, The Edge. A return to the site of this lost-and-rediscovered show: http://rob-mitchum.tumblr.com/post/16135395346/2-23-93-orlando-fl-ok-breaking-in-the-new-home …
  4/30/94: A pretty standard warm-up of Chalkdust and Mound is chased with an early Stash, which seems to always get played in Orlando?
  4/30/94: Mike pulls the Stash jam into a Fikus-y progression, a little jazzier than usual. Waits until the end for the ol’ tension/release.
  4/30/94: Snuck a peek at Sample stats on @phishnet and it’s going to be played at this and THE NEXT FIVE SHOWS. Yikes.
  4/30/94: Reminds me of @lastubbe’s anecdote with @TheBabysMouth about the guy who said he’d quit Phish if they played Sample again.
  4/30/94: Haha, Trey started doing the scratchy intro then had to stop and tell someone in the band that it was “Punch You.” Noobs.
  4/30/94: Pretty good audio on this no-mics Ginseng…from Paul’s board mics?
  4/30/94: Very short first set, only about 50 minutes? What gives?
  4/30/94: Nope, the Wilson chant has not gotten down to Florida yet.
  4/30/94: Busy curlicues kick off the Bowie jam, then settle into a moody, interstellar miniature around the 5th minute. Patient for 94.
  4/30/94: Quiet section ends with a storm of nasty Trey whooshes. That section of the jam was like narration vamping without a narration.
  4/30/94: The first of many Lion Sleeps Tonight teases in the Bowie outro. Probably a Lion King joke, even thought the movie wasn’t out yet?
  4/30/94: First Wolfman’s in 11 shows, despite all the Hoist promo. Nice minimal jam, actually.
  4/30/94: Another jam that finds a soothing, quiet direction in Hood. Nice integration of Lion Sleeps Tonight, digital delay sparkles.
  4/30/94: Cruel, cruel tape flip fadeout over the “you can feel good” ending.
  4/30/94: Little extra stretch to Page’s solo in McGrupp, foreshadowing the Possum that follows (and dropping more Lion teases, of course).
  4/30/94: Oh nice, Possum contains one of those tease digests of the set so far: McGrupp, Wilson, Peaches, Wolfmans, Axilla.
  4/30/94: So much cool stuff used to happen in Possum…
  4/30/94: I guess Fishman doesn’t want to play The Jungle Book in Disney’s backyard. Purple Rain instead, which has its own legal issues.
  4/30/94: Fish yelling at someone to “get off my fucking riser, man, this is drum zone,” during the BBFCFM pause.
  4/30/94: This show wraps up with Purple Rain, BBFCFM, Sleeping Monkey, and Highway to Hell. Heavy on the goofball material.
  4/30/94 Final: Felt a little rushed, but really dense and humorous jamming throughout set II. Early-tour tension on the wane in the FL sun.
