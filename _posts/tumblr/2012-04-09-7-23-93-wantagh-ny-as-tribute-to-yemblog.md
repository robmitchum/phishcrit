7/23/93 - WANTAGH, NY
As tribute to @YEMblog, here’s 7/23/93, Wantagh, NY, Jones Beach Amphitheater. First headline show at JB, after HORDE & Santana in ‘92.
7/23/93: Lot of extemporaneous yelling in the Buried Alive > Rift opening pair. File under good omens.
7/23/93: Caravan is a nice left-field jazz-Phish pick for so early in Set I. Glad they’re not too tight headlining the big shed.
7/23/93: The genre pile-ups are really at peak absurdity in Summer ‘93. Jazz standard > bluegrass > whatever Maze is (jitterprog?)
7/23/93: Maze gets my vote for under-the-radar MVP of July. 2nd hot version in a row, deviates from straight solos into complex interplay.
7/23/93: Every time I hear one of these old extended, acoustic Horses I think Trey’s going to go into Dust in the Wind.
7/23/93: Very cool horror soundtrack organ/Rhodes work from Page in the It’s Ice bridge. Almost sounds like a tease around 5:50.
7/23/93: Trey solo vs. Page scat battle in Lawn Boy. Not LOL funny, more slightly awkward grin funny.
7/23/93: Now I’m hearing phantom teases everywhere. Was that a failed attempt at Alive at the start of Cavern? A scrap of Purple Haze?
7/23/93: If you’re scoring at home, we are up to 6 straight shows with a 2001. Pre-drumbeat space remains the most interesting section.
7/23/93: Makes sense RT @bourgwick: can’t remember if you’ve noted this, but 2001 was specifically a showcase for kuroda’s new lighting rig.
7/23/93: Lots of interesting detours along the ascent in this Antelope, with hints of 94-style ADD explorations. Some proto-Carini riffage.
7/23/93: Aggro Antelope lands in Faht of all things. I dig the piped-in sound fx, super loud in this mix to nicely set up a > MFMF.
7/23/93: This Big Ball Jam was almost listenable for like 20 seconds. Someone with rhythm must have caught a ball.
7/23/93: Actually, possible stage banter explanation - Fish: “They tried to steal it?” Trey: “They ran away.”
7/23/93: A perky YEM jam slowly weaponizes into BBFCFM, because punk was the only musical genre they hadn’t played yet in this show.
7/23/93: With the crazy high energy of this set post-Faht, Chalkdust and Highway to Hell are a fitting end. It’s all devil horns now.
7/23/93: So wait, no vacuum solo, no YEM vocal jam, and a half-listenable Big Ball Jam? All of my 93 albatrosses tamed!
7/23/93 verdict: One of those energy shows that froths into a caffeinated frenzy, but really fun all the same. Maze & Antelope highlights.
7/23/93 addendum: From phish dot com: “Chalk Dust Torture contained teases of Crimes Of The Mind, but The Dude was never brought.”
