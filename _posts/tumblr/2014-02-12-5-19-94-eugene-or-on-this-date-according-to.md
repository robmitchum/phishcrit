  5/19/94 - EUGENE, OR
  On this date, according to Kevin Shapiro, Phish released a cassingle for “Down with Disease” with a very odd b-side: “NO2” from “The White Tape.” I can’t imagine a more perfect physical symbol for the conflict facing Phish in early 1994, a tug-of-war between yearning for mainstream success and exploring new experimental territory. On one side you have “Disease,” the song that announced the dawn of arena-era Phish in its abridged debut on 12/31/93. On the other, “NO2,” four minutes of piercing drill drones, dial tones, laser noises, and Mike making one-sided dentist conversation, followed by an instrumental acoustic guitar duet.
  Those songs nicely represent the two dueling threads on the spring tour of 1994, a split between traditional promotion of the new album (radio sessions, heavy rotation of Hoist songs, song repeats) and the desire to further develop the maniacal, open-ended improvisation they refined in August 1993. These two flavors don’t mix particularly well, which is why so many of the shows from this era don’t really hold together as complete statements, and why a landmark show like the Bomb Factory is the exception, not the rule. Standing in 2014, we know how this story ends, but it’s fascinating to look back and watch the band scratch its collective head at this critical crossroads.
  This night in Eugene fits the narrative well, with the three most heavily-pushed Hoist songs (Disease, Sample, and Julius) all showing up and only a couple flashes of deep improv. Overall, the setlist is very reminiscent of the “starter set” shows of 1993 — not a surprise, since they tended to revert to the introductory formula the farther away they get from established strongholds in New England and Colorado. So a very attentive University of Oregon crowd in a gorgeous venue gets “Cavern” and “Golgi” set closers, jam vehicles in their usual slots halfway through the first set and early in the second, and a “Big Ball Jam” gimmick in lieu of a Fish song. There’s a little weirdness around the edges: the two-beat ripcord segue from “Halley’s Comet” to “Llama,” slightly modified versions of “Horse” and “Silent,” unexplained in-jokes about Chris Kuroda and the “I Love Lucy” theme.
  But the highlight is an incredibly paranoid “Stash” where a restless Trey eventually settles on a roaring chord drone while the other three frantically try to fill the void. After which, the clouds clear briefly while Trey finds a new pattern that is quickly yanked back into nightmare logic.

  5/19/94, Eugene, OR, Silva Concert Hall, Hult Center for the Performing Arts. They skipped over Northern CA in favor of PNW, for now.
  5/19/94: Today in sadly uncirculated soundchecks — an intriguing Blues Jam > Simple > The Fool on the Hill > Arthur’s Theme sequence.
  5/19/94: Surprisingly effective rip-cord segue in Halley’s > Llama, the only time they were ever paired. Great opener.
  5/19/94: A show of openers continues with MFMF, which has a nice extended outro. Is that a “Born on the Bayou” tease starting around 6:20?
  5/19/94: Definitely some coordinated crowd cheers along with the Stash claps. Not so much a “woo!” as a “yeah!”
  5/19/94: Big Trey-drone in the middle of Stash jam, with Mike & Page embellishing the edges. Excellent segment after on an Eastern pattern.
  5/19/94: Some small quirks in Horse > Silent, and then a typical Disease, played for the arena crowds of their near future.
  5/19/94: Some extra words in the Mango chorus I can’t quite make out. One of them sounded like “Toph drew,” then “corrosion”?
  5/19/94: Yeah, a “Topher, we love you” at the end of the set. Some sort of in-joke with @Chrisck5?
  5/19/94: Finally settled in for the second set, and get a plodding Sample opener as reward. Oh well.
  5/19/94: Trey dropping air-raid sirens through the Mike’s first jam, then “Today” teases to kick off the 2nd!
  5/19/94: Now that Simple has made its soundcheck debut, it’s starting to haunt Mike’s. This one is syncopated, but w/o a clear direction.
  5/19/94: Pretty straight ahead Weekapaug, except for a creepy patch of the I Love Lucy theme. Weekapaug really reined in since spring ’93.
  5/19/94: Lizards outro and Julius intro reveal a quiet, well-behaved crowd. You Oregonians are so civilized.
  5/19/94: I Love Lucy theme comes back twice more for BBJ and Hood.  Any explanation?
  5/19/94: The band takes advantage of the quiet crowd to flutter at low volume for a good chunk of the Hood jam. Pretty, music-box-like.
  5/19/94: The encore is a better place for the no-mics mini-set — not that this show had much flow to disrupt in the first place.
  5/19/94: Somebody in the crowd yelled “Shirley Temple!” and got a big ovation. What in the world is going on in this show?
  5/19/94: And Fire makes it a quadruple encore. Haven’t heard one of those so far in the project. (Correction: since 2/21/93)
  5/19/94 Final: Reverting to formulaic setlists, but there’s some weirdness and killer versions of Stash & Hood within for the chill crowd.
