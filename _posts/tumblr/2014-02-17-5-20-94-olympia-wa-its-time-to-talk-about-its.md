  5/20/94 - OLYMPIA, WA
  It’s time to talk about It’s Ice. If you disqualify the heavy-rotation Hoist material, It’s Ice is the oddest participant in the most-played race seven weeks and 38 shows into the 1994 tour, its 14 plays keeping pace with perennials Stash, Antelope, YEM, and Maze. A quick scan of the song history chart reveals that after July 1994, it will never be played so frequently again, settling into the once every 7-to-10 shows rate we see today.
  So it’s fair to say the frequent appearances of It’s Ice in early 1994 are conspicuous. I’ll also argue that its ubiquity is important, and perhaps offers one of the best keys to understanding the changes taking place in their improvisational style at the time.
  But first, let’s take a step back and look at the song It’s Ice. The twelfth track on 1993’s Rift, the last album in the band’s early nerd-prog style, It’s Ice is a triumph of that approach, a bizarre mixture of fairy-tale lyrics, complex compositional sections, overlapping time signatures, and mysterious in-jokes (the Benny Hill theme bassline) that it’s hard to imagine any other band pulling off. The studio version also leaves room for an enticing minute of space (double meaning intended), where a metronomic rhythm, piano runs, and howling, far-off feedback paint an eerie ambience that Phish didn’t often explore at the time.
  In live performances up through 1993, that spacey moment was usually just as fleeting as the one from the studio. But in 1994, a different approach to the It’s Ice breakdown transforms it into a laboratory for a new jamming style. Listening to a bunch of them in succession, the rules become clear: Page will ostensibly “lead” the jam with a busy piano solo, but instead of providing traditional accompaniment, the rest of the band is almost antagonistic to his lines. Fishman purposely avoids drums and steady tempo, focusing on his blocks and cymbals. Trey explores short riffs and rhythmic patterns often unconnected to Page’s piano (compare and contrast with Maze, for instance), often using one of his new effects toys* — the digital delay loop, the wah pedal — that will be critical to future Phish sounds. Mike plays sparse and low, creating a subliminally unsettling floor for the polyphony above and providing the spacewalk tether back to the song.
  The sum is pretty damn avant-garde for a band playing to a few thousand people a night, even if it only tests its audience for two or three minutes in typical 94 versions. But there’s still some payoff for listeners, even if it’s a new, unfamiliar sort of reward. Instead of the classic Phish tension/release move of riding discordance for as long as possible before blissfully resolving, there’s a tension/release here of disorder vs. order. The thrill is watching these four very separate threads sporadically coalesce into a unified whole…which the band then mischievously blows apart a few seconds later. Only occasionally, cf 4/8/94, do they allow one of these spontaneous creations to fully bloom into a more traditional jam; more typically, these segments are a challenging study in withheld gratification.
  By the end of 1994, these types of deep, experimental excursions and avant-garde games would escape from It’s Ice to dominate shows, stretching the boundaries of songs into the 20-minute range and expecting more of their audience and themselves. It’s easy to point to the Bomb Factory Tweezer or the 4/24/94 Bowie as the critical moments where this style was born, but It’s Ice offers a far more regular window into its gestation.
  * - interesting then that the most recent Ice on 12/29/13 gets pretty weird thanks to Trey goofing around with his new Echoplex.

  -> right into 5/20/94, Olympia, WA, Campus Recreation Center, Evergreen College. Let’s check out this weird band down at the Rec Center.
  5/20/94: This is actually the 3rd of 4 times they played the Evergreen St. Rec Center, oddly. First Fee opener since May 1990, it appears.
  5/20/94: Pretty much the same experience as The Gorge, right? http://crosscut.com/media/resized_image/story_image/Evergreen_state_fit_300x300.jpg …
  5/20/94: Short Maze, but still time for a few layered Trey drones. I wish I knew what inspired this change in sound - Boredoms? MBV?
  5/20/94: Bustout alert! First It’s Ice in *three* whole shows.
  5/20/94: Dense Ice jam begins w/ usual piano-and-wah, but finds a 2nd wind when Page/Trey trade a funk lick, & a 3rd when it goes jazz.
  5/20/94: Gin stays mostly within its structure, but a triumphant DWD-ish theme (and a Lion Sleeps Tonight tease) emerges. Weird ending too.
  5/20/94: Both If I Could and FEFY in the first set? I guess someone’s feeling sentimental.
  5/20/94: For all you crazy a cappella fans out there, this is the first Carolina in 56 shows (8/7/93).
  5/20/94: It’s not much yet, but passing the 4-minute mark on 2001 means they are starting to explore some of the fertile ground it offers.
  5/20/94: Yikes, rough transition from the 1st to 2nd segment of Antelope. But the stumbling start adds a little danger to the jam.
  5/20/94: Strange outro to Antelope — about a minute of Trey cadenza, some of it unaccompanied, before he moves it into Weigh.
  5/20/94: The first Weigh of ‘94 actually, and first in 38 shows. It is played incred..ibly sl….ooooo….wwwww.
  5/20/94: Perhaps it’s a tape speed issue (though the vocals sound normal), but this set feels really sluggish, like it’s on quaaludes.
  5/20/94: Despite the big Hoist push, we haven’t heard Wolfman’s since 5/4 w/ horns. Clockwork jam, with a nice sustained note in the middle.
  5/20/94: Woah, wonderful ambient architecture built up in the composed section of YEM. Haven’t heard one that good in a while.
  5/20/94: Very relaxed pace to the YEM jam, built around a simple lick. Feels like a 95 YEM until swerving into an Ob-La-Di jam around 14:30.
  5/20/94: Jam comes to a cold stop before they remember to play the drum-and-bass section. Vocal jam explores Low Rider and primal screams.
  5/20/94: Awfully weird to hear Chalkdust in an encore, even though it fills the send-off role well. A little adrenaline after a sleepy 2nd.
  5/20/94 Final: Not sure what happened at set break, but something felt awry in the 2nd…not always in a bad way. Keen YEM, fun Gin.
