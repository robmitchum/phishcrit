4/30/93 - WEST HARTFORD, CT
Pushing for 1000 followers w/ #phish project show 61: 4/30/93, West Hartford, CT, Sports Center, Univ. of Hartford. http://bit.ly/erescT 
4/30/93: 1st time the Rift-recreating Lengthwise > Maze combo has been used to open a show. Is there a single NE college they didn’t play?
4/30/93: (Just hit 1000 followers! BALLOON DROP AULD LANG SYNE ETC. ETC. Thanks everybody) Oh, and Bouncin’.
4/30/93: Impressionistic jamming from Maze returns in Stash, which first swims in a dark, mellow place and builds to a venomous peak.
4/30/93: Might be wrong, but I think this is the 1st time I’ve heard the Stash clapping in a while. Only a NE thing until ALO came out?
4/30/93: Seems like an eternity since the last Divided Sky, but only a 5-show gap. This one is effortlessly great. CT loves that pause.
4/30/93: Micro-tease of Div Sky between verses of Cavern - pretty cool. Also, mid-set Cavern fake-out keeping fans on their toes.
4/30/93: McGrupp teases thrown into Possum, which borrows some of the manic energy from the previous night. Tour is on its 8th wind.
4/30/93: Another great pre-chanting Wilson intro - feedback bombs, Morricone references. #endthechant
4/30/93: One of the more surprising findings of this crazy experiment - have learned that I’m not a big fan of ‘93 Tweezers.
4/30/93: Although I’ll never complain about a classic, seamless Tweezer > Walk Away. Beats the slowdown ending any day.
4/30/93: Pretty HQ Hood tucked into the middle of this set. Thought Trey was gonna go for a new note-sustain record, but he cut it short.
4/30/93: Trey steals Page’s Mission Impossible tease for YEM. Spiteful quiet jamming ensues. Mike intervenes with a really long bass solo.
4/30/93: When Something is Wrong with My Baby makes final appearance after a week-long fling. Last version is best, but still plastic soul.
4/30/93 verdict: As high energy as the preceding show, but less creative. Blame song choice. Some sparks in Wilson, Stash, Hood.
