7/17/93 - VIENNA, VA
In honor of the summer tour announcement: 7/17/93, Vienna, VA, The Filene Center at Wolf Trap. Pretentious venue names so far.
7/17/93: Landlady opener, for the penultimate time. I guess when you’re playing a classy joint like Wolf Trap, you lead with the jazz.
7/17/93: On the list of things you will only hear in 1993: An audience member yelling “Sample! Yessssss!”
7/17/93: Wolf Trap crowds love to clap along, within Stash and without. Or as co-pilot @misterajp put it, “wolf clappy.”
7/17/93: Some patches of dark clouds in Stash, followed by a Reba that falls to a whisper before riding on in the friscalating dusklight.
7/17/93: Despite genteel environs, this crowd sounds pretty rowdy. Wonder if that’s why the edgiest act at WT in 2012 is an ABBA cover band.
7/17/93: I figured Oh Kee Pa > Bowie would be rare; yea verily, @phishnet confirms it as the only one ever. Jarring cymbal crash connects.
7/17/93: First significant jam of the show, and maybe the tour, in Bowie. A descending riff leads the band into stormy waters. Big peakin’.
7/17/93: If you’re keeping score at home, our 2001 streak is at 2. Time to first peak: 47 seconds. Time between peaks: 7 seconds.
7/17/93: Tweezer jam enters with some cock-rock riffing, disintegrates expertly into an aggressive tension/massive release. One thumb up.
7/17/93: Coil keeps popping up in unusual places lately. Despite Page’s usual brilliance, the preceding Tweezer’s energy is duly sapped.
7/17/93: The summer’s first Big Ball Jam, which seems logistically difficult in an outdoor shed. Surprisingly good drop into Mike’s though.
7/17/93: Noisy, kind of unpleasant Mike’s jam is deconstructed into bleeps and bloops before ending properly.
7/17/93: Tonight, the role of I Am Hydrogen will be played by its understudy, Leprechaun.
7/17/93: Pretty straightforward Weekapaug compared to crazy Spring versions, but a nice segue into a mellow piano HYHU introducing Faht.
7/17/93: Virginia crowd gets Amazing Grace instead of Freebird. Maybe they’re afraid to poke fun at Skynyrd in the South.
7/17/93 verdict: Three shows in, the jams finally join up with summer tour, though only in Bowie and Tweezer as of yet.
