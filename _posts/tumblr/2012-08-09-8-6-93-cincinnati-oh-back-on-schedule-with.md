8/6/93 - CINCINNATI, OH
Back on schedule with 8/6/93, Cincinnati, OH, Cincinnati Zoo Peacock Pavilion. See the city, see the zoo. 
8/6/93: A Melt opener, only the second time that’s happened this year. Last time was a hot show north of the border: http://bit.ly/OHxKgX  
8/6/93: Melt’s on the short side, but still action-packed. They are *this* close to cutting free from the BUM BUM BUM returns. 
8/6/93: Two SONG gap since last Poor Heart. BTW, who booked them to go Miami &gt; Cincy &gt; Darien Lake? Over 1500 miles in 5 days. 
8/6/93: Good to hear The Curtain in its one and only Summer ‘93 appearance, even if the > is wasted on a Sample. 
8/6/93: After a brief run of Phish pop, not mad at Divided Sky. Near-flawless version, like a quartet of prog-rock robots. 
8/6/93: Trey seems to be trying out a set of licks that sound like car alarms these last few shows. 
8/6/93: Suzy caps off a pretty standard set, but foreshadows craziness with Tequila teases, silly voices, and screams. 
8/6/93: I honestly wouldn’t hate it if Phish started every set with Buried Alive. 
8/6/93: Some great vocal jammy things happening between verses on the Tweezer. As I think @heyscottyb once pointed out, always a good sign. 
8/6/93: If You Like Phish Yelling Weird, Random Shit, This Tweezer Is For You. 
8/6/93: Several distinct and open segments in the Tweezer jam, including some “Hey” jamming around 8:00. Tequila theme returns in the outro. 
8/6/93: So I guess mid-set Coils are my arch-enemy for this tour. I don’t mind them when the pre-solo jamming is strong, as it is here. 
8/6/93: Haha, tempting. RT @GuyForgetOPT: @phishcrit Thank you for not stooping to the level of making a “Tequila Papyrus” joke. 
8/6/93: I think somewhere around the tramps section of this YEM, they found every possible variation on teasing Tequila. 
8/6/93: A 180 from the previous show’s YEM, this one is largely funkless, focused on stop-starts and classic rock riffing. Murat-Gin-style. 
8/6/93: Now switching over to the piping fresh Live Bait SBDs for the next two songs. Great timing @shapsio, thank you kindly. 
8/6/93: Nice vocal jam segue into Halley’s. The big bustout is still to come, but this is the first Halley’s of the summer (25 show gap). 
8/6/93: Enjoyed the brief, perky jam between Halley’s and the much-anticipated Slave. Strange to think it was out of rotation for so long. 
8/6/93: Slave does sound a bit rusty - slower at a time when everything else is fast. Majestic jam though…huge Trey tone on this SBD. 
8/6/93: Cracklin’ Rosie dedicated by Fish to Page’s cousin Jack McConnell. Not Dr. Jack, no tap dancing tonight. 
8/6/93: “Cracklin Rosie make me smile/I can’t remember the words but I hope that you know them/Yeah…feelin’ all right.” #fishpoems 
8/6/93 verdict: Possibly more promising than 8/2, because the second set leaned heavier on improv than bustouts. Tweezer and YEM both ++.
