I was there. (dodo dodo-dado dooooo)
23,000 people, maybe 10 of them knew what it was. My friends and I screamed ourselves hoarse and missed pretty much the entire clumsy performance. After the song, we were besieged by setlist-keepers asking for info. And by the time we got to Deer Creek, Crooked Rain Crooked Rain poured from the open windows of campsite cars.

POSTSCRIPT - reader letter from the Doniac Schvice March ‘97 (thanks to Dog Gone Blog)
 
“Trey-What’s up with that Geddy Lee? How does he get his voice so high? I wonder if he talks like an ordinary guy.Sincerely, Dirk N. DeCorners
Dear Dirk:Just because you quote Pavement, it doesn’t mean Trey will like you. But, as it turns out, he does like you. He asked me to pass along his number to you, as long as you don’t tell anyone else – 909.317.0911.Ps. I know him, and he does.- Your Fact Checking Cous”
