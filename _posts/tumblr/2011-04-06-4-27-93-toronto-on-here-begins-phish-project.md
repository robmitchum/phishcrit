4/27/93 - TORONTO, ON
Here begins #phish project show 59: 4/27/93, Toronto, ON, Concert Hall. Just “Concert Hall”? Any help, @stuberman?
4/27/93: As @adam42 forewarned, the first set of this show is uncirculated. So straight to Set II. Adjust your scorecards.
4/27/93: My Friend My Friend outro doesn’t get up to the usual ‘93 tricks, just kind of groans to the Last Laugh. But hey, > ATR!
4/27/93: All Things Reconsidered is in my “best left un-busted-out” pile. Can’t imagine the 3.0 form would do it justice.
4/27/93: Trey’s got a cough. Sounds kinda rough.
4/27/93: From today’s co-pilot - RT @misterajp: @robmitchum this is the jaws 2 of mazes: up to its usual hijinks not too scary
4/27/93: MT @hallsofdevotion: it was indeed called ‘The Concert Hall’ at that point. check out ‘Masonic Temple - toronto’ on wikipedia.
4/27/93: Knew there were Gordon Lightfoot “Sundown” teases in YEM, but didn’t expect them to start with Mike’s solo (cont. in vocal jam)
4/27/93: “Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald” in vocal jam too, and before The Horse, of course (of course). Hope you like Lightfoot, Ontario.
4/27/93: Fishman conducts crowd poll of who likes vs. hates the vacuum. 9 to 1 in favor of love (though Kuroda votes for hate). #ck5
4/27/93: Just a little more Edmund Fitzgerald in the big finish to Cavern/Set II. #lightfootfest
4/27/93 verdict: Doesn’t seem fair to judge a show on the basis of half a set, but not much liftoff achieved here for non-Lightfoot fans.
