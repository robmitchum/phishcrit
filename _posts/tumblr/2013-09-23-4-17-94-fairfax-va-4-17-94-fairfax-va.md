  4/17/94 - FAIRFAX, VA
  4/17/94, Fairfax, VA, Patriot Center, George Mason University. At the end of the Orange Line. http://t.co/pkTjXqR9P9
  4/17/94: Loving Cup opener, always reminds me of the start of this project, so long ago. First one in 30 shows, prefer it as a rarity.
  4/17/94: Wiki says Phish holds the concert attendance record (10,356) at the Patriot Center, but doesn’t specify if it’s this show or Oct’s.
  4/17/94: Trey’s string scrape when he flubs a segment (like he does, badly, in this Foam) is like a guitar swearing.
  4/17/94: The vacuum solo in I Didn’t Know is “a musical picture of what Fishman thinks of Mike’s black socks,” according to Trey.
  4/17/94: A little scared by all the 1s and 2s in the third column of this chart… http://phish.net/song/down-with-disease …
  4/17/94: Page chooses this particular Disease to go wild on the piano instead of sticking with the organ. Interesting feel.
  4/17/94: A bunch of Purple Haze teases threaded through Cavern. Kind of a lazy tease, but at least it set this Cavern apart.
  4/17/94: Second-set opening Bowie feels very fluid, non-linear and full of exchange at a brisk pace. Could be aimless, but isn’t.
  4/17/94: Now Page is playing the composed part of Wolfman’s on the Rhodes instead of regular piano. Some weird keys decisions in this show.
  4/17/94: Interesting jam in the Wolfman’s, taut and uncluttered. Total 180 from the preceding Bowie jam too, which is impressive.
  4/17/94: The Sloth is another song we haven’t heard in a while (since 12/28/93). They’re cracking the songbook open a little in this show.
  4/17/94: And a 3rd type of jamming for this set shows up in a solid Reba, untroubled by tension and flowing to a peak rimmed with digifuzz.
  4/17/94: A late Maze continues the weird placements in this set. Glad to see them breaking routine, even if it lacks flow in this instance.
  4/17/94: Cracklin’ Rosie and a punchy Axis in the encore give us two more ‘94 debuts, not to mention the rare Neil/Jimi pairing.

  4/17/94 Final: 2nd set brings a broad sampler of above-average jamming and a less predictable setlist. Not very patriotic though.
