3/27/93 - SAN FRANCISCO, CA

OK, gonna try and get 3/93 done before summer tour starts - #phish project show 37: 3/27/93, San Francisco, CA, Warfield Theatre (Night 2) June 3, 2010 12:41:18 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/27/93: Stash diverts light early set to a darker path - jam contains good solid minute of band in evil, lock-groove repetition mode. June 3, 2010 1:14:25 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/27/93: Reba jams that hit the ground running vs. Reba jams where Trey sits silent in the cut for a while: Discuss. (this is the latter) June 3, 2010 1:21:38 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/27/93: Fishman’s trombone solo in I Didn’t Know introduced as “a message of love across the continent to Nancy, who wrote this song.” June 3, 2010 2:03:54 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/27/93: Monster set-closing Bowie, 15+ minutes when that was rare. Page sets an unsettled pace, good rhythm/lead alternation from Trey. June 3, 2010 2:20:59 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/27/93: Buried Alive > Halley’s Comet makes it a Nancy Taube double. But um, wow are they out of tune. Where’s their pitch pipe? June 3, 2010 2:28:27 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/27/93: First TMWSIY > Avenu > TMWSIY since the 2nd show of the tour, 38 dates ago. We #phish fans love our lengthy acronyms. June 3, 2010 2:51:05 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/27/93: Mike’s jam disintegrates into a flubstorm 6min in, but band makes the most of it. Kind of an interesting bit of slop, actually. June 3, 2010 3:14:17 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/27/93: “On Broadway” jam in Weekapaug, kind of crunchy and Neil Young-Freedom-style. Sparse, frantic segment after is the real meat. June 3, 2010 3:28:08 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/27/93: Lots of audience/band chatter before “Carolina” including the weird acapella Suzy Greenberg intro from 2/21/93. Type II acapella. June 3, 2010 3:59:34 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/27/93 verdict: Excellent old-school show, A++, will listen again. Rippin’ Stash, Reba, Bowie, ‘Paug, and a smooth Coil chaser. June 3, 2010 4:02:12 PM CDT via TweetDeck
