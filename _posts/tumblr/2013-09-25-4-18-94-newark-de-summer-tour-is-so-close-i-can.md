  4/18/94 - NEWARK, DE
  Summer tour is so close I can smell it (ew). 4/18/94, Newark, DE, Bob Carpenter Center, University of Delaware. http://t.co/Ws4nCNHCXX
  4/18/94: Pretty standard open to the show, so I looked up Bob Carpenter - he was the Phillies’ owner from 1943-72. #themoreyouknow
  4/18/94: Quick Buried Alive tease at 4:48 in Julius. My tease-spotting game is on point lately. (cc @bizarchive)
  4/18/94: Julius is noticeably looser than the stiff versions at the start of tour. Hoist material breaking in like a baseball glove.
  4/18/94: Melt w/ a couple minutes of noisy goodness, but reined in pretty fast. Would’ve been a strong ‘93 version, but it’s ‘94 now, baby.
  4/18/94: First audible Dog Faced Boy, after the no-mics version at the Beacon. Basically Trey solo.
  4/18/94: AC/DC Bag, with the weird ascending part at the end, is one of my favorite Phishy set closers.
  4/18/94: OK, what did you Delaware people do to deserve 2001 > Sample?
  4/18/94: Perhaps it’s the songiness, perhaps it’s the arenas, but these ‘94 shows feel really short, fast-paced.
  4/18/94: Just as I type “fast-paced,” Gin jam hits an uptempo stretch. Nice unison melodizing from Trey and Page. Lots of riff callbacks.
  4/18/94: I’m glad the Gin jam a la Sparkle approach wasn’t permanent, but that was a nice, unique version with a well-stuck landing.
  4/18/94: Shoutouts to Trey’s wife *and* grandpa in Ya Mar. It’s a family affair in Delaware.
  4/18/94: First Mike’s since before Trey’s ankle injury, and his call for volunteers reminded me that Mike’s once had a tramps section. #n00b
  4/18/94: Always happy to hear TMWSIY sub in for Hydrogen. First time since 8/7/93.
  4/18/94: Back-to-back Diseases for the third time this year already. Still no drift from the main theme, though I like Page’s piano comps.
  4/18/94: Fish’s I Wanna Be Like You one-man show is getting odder and odder. “I didn’t know monkeys played vacuum cleaners, King Louie!”
  4/18/94: Haha, “one-legged” drum solo from Trey, followed by a one-finger bass solo from Mike.
  4/18/94: Cavern closer leaves the Mike’s Groove unfinished. Did they forget? Is it impossible to play on one leg? RI/DE rivalry?
  4/18/94 Final: A songy show with some setlist swerves. Wind sprint Gin is the most memorable piece. Hi. I’m in Delaware.
