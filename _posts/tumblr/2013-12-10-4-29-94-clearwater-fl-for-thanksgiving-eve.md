  4/29/94 - CLEARWATER, FL
  For Thanksgiving Eve, let’s do 4/29/94, Clearwater, FL, Boatyard Village Pavilion. Will they be operating thetans or suppressive persons?
  4/29/94: Gonna try my best not to be all scientology jokes this show, but a Halley’s Comet opener has to be intentional, right?
  4/29/94: YEM for the second song of the show? Hello. First first-set YEM of my project, not counting festie one-setters.
  4/29/94: Noisy anti-solo from Trey in the YEM jam, then a hushed, jazzy section, then dark power chords with high-pitched nonsense vox. Rad.
  4/29/94: A slowdown section segues YEM into FEFY, no bass/drums or vocal jam. Weird start to this show, dig it.
  4/29/94: “Boatyard Village Pavilion” is sort of mysteriously absent from the internet. Closest I could find is this: …http://quasi-interestingparaphernaliainc.blogspot.com/2010/04/so-what-heck-happened-to-boatyard.html …
  4/29/94: Lots of “Hey!”s from Trey during the klezmer part of Mule. How did they know I’d get to this show on the first day of Hanukkah?
  4/29/94: This is a good spot for a Divided Sky after a pretty manic start to the show. Slow down, smooth out the emotions.
  4/29/94: Great Divided Sky jam. This is a totally different band from the last show, maybe thanks to 220 miles of travel vs. 600.
  4/29/94: We’ve achieved a Double Nancy before the first set is even over. Fish on washboard…no vacuum since 4/22?
  4/29/94: Very menacing ebb and flow to this Melt, laced with frightening “Yeehaw!”s from the band. + “Ice Ice Baby”/“Under Pressure” jam.
  4/29/94: Instead of finishing up properly, Melt diverts into the first Sanity in 201 shows! Last played 5/17/92.
  4/29/94: Okay, Melt > Sanity > MMGAMOIO…there is no way they are not intentionally trolling scientologists here.
  4/29/94: We close with a Llama where Trey goes Fripp over looped sustain. What a great show! Wait, there’s another whole set?
  4/29/94: RT @Axn__Jxn: @phishcrit The old Pharmer’s Almanac has a review that says the band took a boat ride during setbreak.
  4/29/94: Great drop from Suzy into Maze. More looped sustain, harmonics from Mike, extra helpings of foreboding dread.
  4/29/94: With how deliciously unhinged this show is, it’s nice that they found room for both FEFY and If I Could. Phish cares about us.
  4/29/94: “Interesting” fact - all the Rebas in 94 since the first show have come in the second set.
  4/29/94: Cascading lead from Trey in Reba, gets a little ringtone in spots, but finishes strong. Simpsons signal doesn’t find much purchase.
  4/29/94: Fee mini-jam is a strange note-flurry conversation between all four members, with a quick Mule tease.
  4/29/94: More gibberish in Mike’s — this show is chock full of extemporaneous vocals. Beautiful descending chord progression in the 2nd jam.
  4/29/94: A straightforward Weekapaug in the context of this nutty show. Oh, and there’s the vacuum for I Wanna Be Like You - I jinxed it.
  4/29/94: “It was sparsely attended and the band was hanging out with fans and friends at a barbecue near the venue” - http://phish.com

  4/29/94 Audit: Decent 2nd set can’t keep up the mayhem of the first, but that’s OK. A crazy show that occasionally goes clear.
