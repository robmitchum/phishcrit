  5/27/94 - SAN FRANCISCO, CA
  One of the wonderful things about the voluminous Phish live catalog is that it has a taxonomy that can be appreciated on multiple scales. There’s the atomic level of individual song performances*, which combine on a nightly basis into broader set-long and show-long architectures. There’s the narrative formed by a given tour, or a particular year of touring. And then there’s the grand structure of the different eras, or the entire body of 1700-some shows and counting.
  Between the show and tour scales is an intermediate level, that of the multi-show, single-venue run. In modern-day Phish, these mini-residencies are becoming the norm instead of the exception — the tentpoles of this summer’s tour will be three-show runs in Saratoga Springs, New York City, Chicago, and Colorado. Clearly, the idea of not getting in a tour bus every night appeals to them in their older age, and the quality of these shows usually reflects a preference for a mini-residency.
  But back in the early 90s, multiple-show runs were still a new idea. The famous Roxy run was the only three-night stand of 1993, and near as I can tell, the band’s first ever**, not counting primordial residencies in Burlington and Colorado ski towns. In 1994, they almost bookend the spring tour with three-night theatre runs at the Beacon in New York City and the Warfield in San Francisco, neither of which approach the creative chaos of the Roxy shows. 
  Part of the problem is that, in 1994, Phish hadn’t yet mastered the pacing of a show, or even a set, so expecting an overarching three-show structure is pretty silly. For one, listening to multiple nights in a row reveals the formulaic nature of their setlists at the time. They also aren’t quite cocky enough yet to assume that a healthy chunk of the audience will even be there for all three shows, so there’s no obligation to avoid repeating songs or segments such as the acoustic set that has become standard by the end of May. 

  At the Beacon and the Warfield, the band does nod to repeat visitors by evenly distributing their jam vehicles over the three nights, but each show doesn’t really spontaneously grow into its own unique identity within the run like you often see today. Instead, the final show of each run is rigged to be unique with special guests (the Giant Country Horns on 4/15, fiddler Morgan Fichter and soprano Andrea Baker on 5/27) and pasta-related gimmicks.
  If you squint real hard though, the Warfield run does offer a miniaturized version of the transitional period acted out in Spring 1994. The 5/25 show is the past, using a very 1993 structure with first-set narration and Big Ball Jam/Fish-song novelties in the second. 5/26, like a lot of 1994 shows, veers between contained oddity (recreating Demand > Split Open and Melt and tacking Catapult onto the end of It’s Ice), Hoist promotion, old proggy favorites, and no-mics experiments, never quite finding cohesion. Then 5/27 contains heaps of foreshadowing for the rest of the year, with patient, communicative improv in Bowie, Reba, and Hood*** that could fit right into A Live One and the raucous debut of Simple, a lovably dopey song that signifies a step back from the measured mainstream overtures of Hoist****.
  Extended runs went back on the shelf after the Warfield — the band won’t do another three-show run until The Fox Theatre in fall 95, and there are only four two-show runs over the rest of the very busy 1994 calendar. Like the restless improvisational style that would come to dominate this era, staying in one place for too long just didn’t suit Phish (or their fans) in 1994. Before they could write the novels of a thematic tour, or the short stories of a multi-show run, Phish still had to figure out how to write, well, an essay, regularly crafting shows that were more than just a collection of independent songs and jams. Eventually, most shows (and runs and tours and years) will spell something, but we’re not quite there yet.
  * - one could even get down to segments within jams, but let’s consider those the quarks and bosons of Phish physics.
  ** - They played three nights in a row at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in 1992, but only as opening act for Santana
  *** - So good, I had to cheat and go with two examples of full-band interplay for today’s sound clip.
  **** - I know Simple was written for Hoist, but it’s telling that it didn’t make the cut and wasn’t played live until two months into the year.

  Finishing off the Warfield run with 5/27/94, San Francisco, CA, Warfield Theatre. I’m told this one will go better. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-27 …
  5/27/94: The band does a few extra rounds of “duh-nuh, duh-nuh” so that the Wilson chant can spread. Clearly they’re in on it by now.
  5/27/94: I suppose Jim > Foam is slightly more notable when it doesn’t open the show. So many repeated song pairings these days.
  5/27/94: Haha, awesomely awkward drop from Bouncin’ into Bowie. You don’t hear that transition too often.
  5/27/94: Creepy/boss Bowie jam, with Trey and Mike call-response, tidal patterns darkly mutating, perverse tension and minimal release.
  5/27/94: If I Could is currently the go-to cooldown after a hot jam. I will take it over Lifeboy any day of the week.
  5/27/94: Accidental drums-only intro to PYITE makes it sound an awful lot like Melt.
  5/27/94: Feisty Hood intro and a jam that’s like the Bowie’s good twin. Atmosphere from Trey, concrete melodic foundation by Mike.
  5/27/94: Maybe it’s the SBD, maybe it’s that I’m listening on my home setup, but Mike is much more tangible than 94-usual in this show.
  5/27/94: This second set comes out with its hair on fire. Suzy and Peaches and MFMF, pulse racing.
  5/27/94: Strange Trey tone at the near-silent start of the Reba jam, warbly and far-off. Lots of room to expand, Mike very active again.
  5/27/94: They saved a lot of heavy-hitters for the end of the run here, and they’re 3 for 3 so far on the jams.
  5/27/94: Lizards is fitting after @misterajp and I were playing “what if True Detective used Gamehendge instead of The Yellow King” today.
  5/27/94: Julius is only the second repeat of the run, joining Sample. Only 2 Hoist songs in this show too, interestingly.
  5/27/94: Good way to freshen up the 3rd acoustic mini-set in 3 days: Camper Van Beethoven alum Morgan Fichter on fiddle!
  5/27/94: First and only acoustic MMGAMOIO too.
  5/27/94: We’ve got Simple! The debut sprouts from Mike’s a lot earlier than expected, and it’s still pretty rough. But I’m glad it’s here.
  5/27/94: Argh, harsh edit between Simple and O Mio Babbino Caro on Phishtracks. Is that universal? Do I need to seek out a different source?
  5/27/94: OK so song debut, opera singer, Flintstones macaroni and cheese distribution, all in about 10 minutes. Concentrated weirdness.
  5/27/94: Macaroni gag is fun, but it sounds like they’re playing in a rainstorm, cf 7/22/93. Also, shouldn’t they have used Rice-A-Roni?
  5/27/94: Nice gesture to donate the boxes, but some SF food bank must have gotten really sick of Flintstones mac and cheese in June.
  5/27/94 Final: Craziness at the end was good antidote to the previous nights’ blandness, but the real thrills were in Bowie, Hood, & Reba.
