  5/29/94 - MONTEREY, CA
  The end of the spring tour seems like a good time to assess The State of The Phish. But in this case, it doesn’t feel quite right. For one, treating this show as the end of a tour is kind of a joke, as the band takes exactly ten days off before starting their way back eastward on the summer leg. But more broadly speaking, if I was filling out a report card for Phish at the end of May 1994, the grade probably couldn’t be anything but “Incomplete.”
  Not to sound like a broken record, but there’s not another time in Phish history when the struggle between mainstream and underground is so tensely pitched. Until this year, the band has enjoyed a slow, steady, word-of-mouth climb from New England obscurity to moderate success, able to fill theatres with a few thousand seats from coast to coast and sell a goodly amount of albums. In the traditional music industry trajectory, that’s the time where you make the push for the big time: radio singles, arena shows, and $$$.
  Please know that I’m not making the tired, shallow accusation that Phish was “selling out.” These were the logical choices to make, given where their career sat at this point in time. Certainly, recording some shorter, slicker songs and performing them every other night made a lot more long-term sense than playing set-long Tweezers. And as I mentioned in the 5/21/94 essay, Dave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler would demonstrate by the end of the year that jamband crossover success was definitely possible.
  Still, there’s no question that operating under these conditions makes for a very weird spring tour. And that’s “very weird” in the sense that it’s not weird enough, dialing back the usual Phish oddness considerably. They promote the new album dutifully, playing Sample at a relentless 30 of 46 shows (65%) and fitting in 25 Down with Diseases and Juliuses as well. The Intro to Phish setlist format of the first half of 1993 returns, but with the Big Ball Jam initially removed and the frequency of Fish songs reduced. The new novelty set piece, the acoustic/no-mics setup, is a much more traditional change of pace, even if one band member is wearing a washboard with breasts and occasionally performing an “emotion solo.”
  But as usually happens with Phish, the tighter the limitations, the more creativity squeezes out from unexpected directions. On this leg, the professional veneer starts to slip on the southern swing, with weird shows in Clearwater, Charlotte, and Atlanta that dip deeper into the back catalog and start to suggest promising new improvisational directions. Oh yeah, and there’s a Saturday night in Dallas that gets pretty heavy too.
  The thing about the Bomb Factory is that it really is an island within the calm seas of spring ‘94. Part of why I started this project is because I wanted to explore the space around the landmark shows that are a part of every fan’s collection, looking for less obvious transition points in the band’s evolution. But there is very little from the first month of shows in 1994 to suggest that something like the Bomb Factory is coming, and seemingly miniscule impact in the shows following. If anything, the band gets safer again as it travels west, playing some gentle, soothing shows in Santa Fe and San Diego, but nothing approaching the challenging and wonderfully self-indulgent Tweezerfest.
  So you have to look a little harder for the incremental steps forward taken while the band largely treads water. As I wrote in the 5/20/94 essay, It’s Ice offers the most consistent laboratory for the testing of new ideas, providing a space where the band consciously splits off in four different directions to see if a truly spontaneous pattern forms from the chaos. There are a handful of Bowies, Antelopes and Gins that offer a glimpse of this approach on a larger scale, where the band eschews their traditional building-storm, tension/release approach in favor of lateral, fickle journeys that cycle through a number of unique themes.
  Other advances are even more subtle. Trey introduces the digital delay and wah pedals, signaling a shift towards more atmospheric, effects-driven playing that would shape the band’s direction for the rest of the decade*. There appears to be a conscious effort to create more room for Page, with It’s Ice, McGrupp, the pre-duel Mule and, of course, Coil offering him opportunities to take the lead role. The move from tension/release to a more iterative jamming style lets Mike get a more frequent hand on the steering wheel, while simultaneously giving Fishman more responsibility to keep these restless excursions from floating off into free space.
  But for the most part, in the tug of war between going more mainstream and getting more experimental, the mainstream is winning in spring 1994. Extended episodes are rare, and weirdly, less frequent as the tour goes on, even as Hoist falls from its Billboard peak only 17 spots higher than Rift hit the year before. Avant-garde epics like the Bozeman Tweezer or the Providence Bowie still sound completely impossible for anything but that odd, aggressively care-free version of the band that showed up in the second set on May 7th.
  Yet there’s a glimmer of hope in these final two shows headlining the Laguna Seca Daze festival. Beneath them on the bill are a bunch of bands that found the radio fame Phish sought in 1994, most of whom are considered trivia answers or punchlines today. Instead of pandering to fans there to see “Hey Jealousy” and “What’s Going On,” Phish plays two relaxed shows containing patient improvisation and a smattering of inside jokes. On the 29th, they bend a multi-band festival at a speedway into their tour-closing party, playing two encores for a crowd that, by the end of the show, is audibly smaller…and audibly psyched as fuck. It’s a subversion of the traditional music industry promotional machinery that might not work for everybody in the audience, but makes true believers of those it does reach. Soon, very soon, they’ll figure out that this is the path for them.

  It’s the end of spring tour! 5/29/94, Monterey, CA, Laguna Seca Raceway. Last show for a whopping *11* days. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-29 …
  5/29/94: Day 2 of Laguna Seca Daze was somehow even more 90s than Day 1: 4 Non Blondes, Big Head Todd, The Mother Hips and Meat Puppets.
  5/29/94: Fittingly, this is the first Divided Sky opener since 4/4, the first show of the year/spring.
  5/29/94: Simpsons secret language in Guelah w/o much response. Pretty cheeky to do at a multi-band festival.
  5/29/94: It’s nice to have an AUD after the previous show’s SBD to judge audience reception. Like 3 people are excited to hear Halley’s.
  5/29/94: Final tally for spring tour: 46 shows, 30 Samples, 25 Diseases.
  5/29/94: 25 Juliuses too. Julii?
  5/29/94: Double Nancy in the first set, Fish introduced for I Didn’t Know vacuum solo as “Mr. Al Unser Jr.” They’re on a raceway, you see.
  5/29/94: Takes a little while for an idea to find purchase in Bowie jam, so Trey, Page and Mike play melodic triple dutch instead.
  5/29/94: A Trey “hey” shortly before the ending trills begin suggests some underlying structure to the jam, but it’s a weird one.
  5/29/94: Guessing nobody called Nellie Kane for a second set opener. Played electric, despite its recent home in the acoustic setup.
  5/29/94: Could be the flip to SBD, but the whole band attacks this Melt jam right away with more bite than anything in the first set.
  5/29/94: It’s a joy to have a louder Mike over the last few shows. He’s still not *Mike!*, but his counterpoints to Trey are fascinating.
  5/29/94: Trey and Fish gibberish over Melt. Sounds like Barenaked Ladies meets Rollins Band, to keep it appropriately 90s.
  5/29/94: At 10th min, Melt jam takes new direction. Grungy riff, wah pedal, choppiness, quiet/loud ending. That traveled a long distance.
  5/29/94: Hey Esther, it’s been a while. 18 shows, to be exact. Still creepy, I see.
  5/29/94: Horn has been missing for a while too, 17 shows. Maybe they’re practicing the deep catalog for the summer trek back eastward.
  5/29/94: This set was getting a little sleepy, so it’s Suzy and Antelope to the rescue. Old TV theme I can’t place in the Antelope intro.
  5/29/94: I probably wouldn’t have said this while doing summer ’93, but now that it’s a rare-ish treat, I’m going to miss Free Bird.
  5/29/94: The crowd is chanting “One more set!” pre-encore. Damn, pretty audacious, guys.
  5/29/94: The 2nd encore (!), starts with piano trio jazz while Fish sings “the guitar player/is taking a leak.”
  5/29/94: A pleasantly unrushed Hood, despite the presumably late hour. The crowd sounds pretty thinned out, but they are into it.
  5/29/94 Final: Maybe not as deep as the first night, but still a solid tour closer even in the festival setting. Enjoy your break, boys.
