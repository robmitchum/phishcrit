  8/20/93 - MORRISON, CO
  Segueing into the holidays with 8/20/93, Morrison, CO, Red Rock. This is Red Rocks, This is The Phish!
  8/20/93: This was one of my first batch of tapes, and I distinctly remember the show being on XLII-S tapes for some reason. Fancy!
  8/20/93: Divided is a repeat from the previous show, but I’ll allow it due to the venue and weather situation. http://bit.ly/R8ZEVu 
  8/20/93: For a tape that turned up in a lot of Phish starter kits, Trey is mixed awfully low. Strange setlist for the era too: Harpua 2nd?
  8/20/93: Via @misterajp, this is a band’s view from the stage at Red Rocks: http://bit.ly/R90PV2 
  8/20/93: Most of you probably know the Giant Iguana narration, so I won’t try to summarize. Excellent dramatic work by Page & Mike though.
  8/20/93: Maze is the 2nd repeat in the first 4 songs, but, granted, the last show was 600 miles away. Good Maze.
  8/20/93: Ahh, so this version is why I’m always expecting more from ‘93 It’s Ice breakdowns. Awesomely obtuse Page solo.
  8/20/93: Oh yeah, The Wedge, last seen 63 shows ago. Huge bummer that this Page-intro version didn’t get more play in this era.
  8/20/93: Trey sez “I’d like to dedicate this song to Brad Sands, the guy that tunes my guitar.” Brad had a lot of jobs in those days.
  8/20/93: Two uses of Page’s “Chairman of the Boards” nickname already. It’s not *that* funny.
  8/20/93: The set’s first opportunity for non-narrative improv gives us a deranged variation on CYHMK in Antelope. Nice.
  8/20/93: The new improv style of cycling through multiple themes (instead of a linear climb) is really starting to congeal.
  8/20/93: They’re also getting better at returning to the standard jam progression from more open exploration: this Antelope, 8/17’s Bowie.
  8/20/93: We now join the second set, already in progress (though I didn’t bat an eye at a 2-minute long 2001 in my iTunes).
  8/20/93: And 11 shows after Cincy, Slave is back in the rotation for good. Sounds pretty weird coming out of 2001 though.
  8/20/93: Gorgeous, shimmery beginning to the Slave jam, like it was imported from YEM’s ambient section.
  8/20/93: Understated work from Trey on the Split jam, which isn’t deviating as far from the theme as usual of late.
  8/20/93: Woah, diginoise perfectly in time with the Split jam motif at 9:30.
  8/20/93: Are mid-set Coils winning me over? They do seem to inspire more full-band jamming before the Page solo, and that’s a win-win.
  8/20/93: Well-played versions of MFMF, Chalkdust keep the set energy up w/o leaving a very deep impression. YEM goin’ the quiet route.
  8/20/93: Mimi Fishman appearance aside, this 2nd set is mostly pretty standard post-Coil. Might be why it’s a good beginner’s tape though.
  8/20/93: I remember this Mango (likely the first one I heard) being the song that most caught my ear when I first got this tape. Strange?
  8/20/93 verdict: Fueled more by an inventive setlist than the improv, though the Antelope is strong. Atypical for 8/93, but a good intro.
