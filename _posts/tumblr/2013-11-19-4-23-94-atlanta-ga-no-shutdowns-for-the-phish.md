  4/23/94 - ATLANTA, GA
  No shutdowns for the Phish Project. 4/23/94, Atlanta, GA, The Fox Theatre. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-23/ …
  4/23/94: Funky Bitch is the first of 1994 and the first in 42 shows?! Nice Trey callback to the “roller coaster” effect from 4/22 Bowie.
  4/23/94: Flipped through The Phish Book this weekend and caught Mike’s quote on how hard it is to play “bouncy” music like Fee. Interesting.
  4/23/94: I guess this Fee is pretty bouncy, other than a brief megaphone malfunction. Yet another teasing, 30-second mini-jam at the end.
  4/23/94: Trey finds the first jam theme in Stash before they’re even done singing the maybe so maybe nots. Exploring that car alarm drone.
  4/23/94: Aggressively percussive ending to Stash, Fish warding off Trey’s attacks by abusing his crash cymbal. Angry!
  4/23/94: Fishman banging on the walls of the Disease jam by toying with the beat. A few short detours, most interesting version yet?
  4/23/94: The sociability of this SE swing continues with Merl Saunders sitting in on Caravan and singing High-Heel Sneakers.
  4/23/94: High-Heel Sneakers revealing Phish’s bar-bandish limpness (at least in ‘94) on an R&B groove. But it’s an earnest attempt.
  4/23/94: First Wilson since the Beacon, and the chant has not yet caught on. Need to wait for those tapes to circulate…
  4/23/94: Antelope accelerates to bonkers status quickly in the 2nd section, then stretches out the 3rd w/ language and melodic weaving.
  4/23/94: Both Mound and Sample getting some serious reverb from The Fox acoustics. Sounds kind of immense.
  4/23/94: They are really taking their time on this (oddly mid-set) Hood, both in the intro and the outset of the jam. Breezy.
  4/23/94: Very interesting to hear them do “atmospheric” years before they had all the fancy gear to go full ambient.
  4/23/94: Microphone-less Ginseng is barely audible, but if you concentrate you can just hear the return of Page’s melodica.
  4/23/94: I think Fishman might have dropped a drumstick in this YEM, creating a surprise stop-start jam in the composed portion.
  4/23/94: I was just wondering if Trey was still in his cast. Another crowd volunteer chosen for YEM tramps.
  4/23/94: Apparently the volunteer failed. Be honest: who among you would be able to do the whole tramps routine if called upon?
  4/23/94: Very thorough “Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo” jam in this YEM, and I have to admit, I always thought that was The Nuge until just now.
  4/23/94: Noisy piano duet w/ Col. Bruce after the YEM bass & drums, vocal jam rapidly segues into a Leonard Cohen cover, of all things
  4/23/94: So just for the record, we’ve gone from Norman Blake to Rick Derringer to Leonard Cohen in the last half hour. #phishisweird
  4/23/94: Oh, and an a cappella version of Skynyrd for the encore.

  4/23/94 Final: Combine some of the Roxy’s manic craziness with more “mature” jams in Stash/Antelope/Hood and unintrusive guests. Top notch.
