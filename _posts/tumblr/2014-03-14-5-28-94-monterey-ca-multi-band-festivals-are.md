  5/28/94 - MONTEREY, CA

  Multi-band festivals are one of those strange places where the Phish timeline doubles back on itself. From 1996 through 2009, it was unthinkable that Phish would play a festival that they hadn’t organized themselves, and where they weren’t the only performer.* On one hand, it was an impressive display of their clout and their fanbase’s dedication that they could stage a massive destination event as the sole organizer and attraction. On the other other, those single-band festivals were symptomatic of the weird isolationism of Phish in late 1.0 and 2.0, when they seemingly didn’t care about preaching outside of their choir loft or actively seeking new fans.

  But before Jerry’s death launched them suddenly to the top of the jamband power rankings, Phish had to play the game just like everyone else. That meant serving as opening act, occasionally using an opening act or sharing a double bill, and playing multi-band festivals, such as HORDE, Laguna Seca Daze, and — my favorite — the Ancient Forests Benefit in Portland in 1993. As you might expect, these shows are as Intro to Phish as possible: one set, always featuring a vacuum solo and trampolines, no extended improv. The only thing I remember from listening to these shows was the gag where a John Popper dummy in a wheelchair fell from the rafters to close a HORDE stop in Richmond.

  It’s a festival formula familiar to any 3.0 fan as well, who have seen “the real Phish” fail to show up for outreach efforts at Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Austin City Limits**. It makes a ton of sense for them to play it safe in these environments — Phish are an immensely weird band, and it’s good guest behavior not to drop a 20-minute rotation jam on an unsuspecting festival crowd that just wants to see Jack White. But it’s also a bit disappointing to see them put forth a somewhat edited version of the Phish experience for the rare audience that isn’t already pre-converted. Ask any Phish fan what caught their ear at their first Phish show, and it’s usually not a well-played Chalk Dust solo or a Sample. Does a stiffer, more accessible Phish create more new fans than an unfiltered Phish?

  The band may have been testing that question themselves here, when they headlined two nights of the same Laguna Seca Daze fest where they served as mid-lineup support for the Allman Brothers Band and 10,000 Maniacs in 1993. Maybe because they were top of the heap and  allowed to preserve their two-set format, these shows are much closer to the abnormal normal of a Phish show circa 1994 — in fact, maybe a little weirder than the majority of Hoist-flogging sets we’ve heard in the year so far. In a canny move, they front-load the first set of the 28th with the “singles” from the last three albums, just in case they catch the ear of any departing Gin Blossoms fans. But by the second set, they’re rewarding the fans with delightfully off-model versions of It’s Ice and Reba and possibly the most exploratory Tweezer since *that* Tweezer three weeks ago***.

  Maybe, just maybe, this looseness in front of strangers carries over to the summer and fall tours in their newfound spirit of transcendent self-indulgence. Maybe it’s just a giddiness that they have a whole ten days off after this festival before they start a long road back east. But on the lowered expectation scale of festival shows, this one (and to a lesser extent, the following night) is a darn good one. Now, in the present, which version of festival Phish will show up at Jazz Fest next month?

  * - with the exception of Oswego, which is always complicating blanket statements about Phish festivals.

  ** - I know there are some scattered highlights at these shows, but none of them are making anybody’s must-hear list. For instance, how many of you forgot they even *played* Outside Lands or Austin City Limits.

  *** - And by the end of the show they’re indulging in the sort of guest-addled YEM jam that is too much Phish even for *me* to handle.

  Back on the festival circuit with 5/28/94, Monterey, CA, Laguna Seca Raceway. First of two headlining shows for Laguna Seca Daze.
  5/28/94: Opening acts for this date included Gin Blossoms, Freddy Jones Band, and Primus side project Sausage. #rememberthe90s
  5/28/94: Honestly kind of surprised that Phish could headline two nights of a west coast festival (playing 2 sets each night) in ’94.
  5/28/94: Based on the quiet jam of this Foam, sounds like there was some serious wind in Monterey on this night. It’s a SBD, even.
  5/28/94: I think they front-loaded this set with “the hits” (Rift, Sample, Bouncin’) in case any Gin Blossoms fans tried to sneak out early.
  5/28/94: Stash is its usual mounting tension self until the 9th minute, when it suddenly takes a bittersweet interlude for 90 seconds.
  5/28/94: “That was for the people on the ferris wheel,” Trey says. Isn’t there a similar dedication at one of the Phish fests?
  5/28/94: I’ve now heard Great Went, Lemonwheel, and Superball on the Ferris Wheel dedication question. Maybe he just does it every fest.
  5/28/94: Pretty “clean” Maze in context, light on the screaming fields of sonic love.
  5/28/94: Another kaleidoscopic Ice breakdown, this is not a repeat. Microfunk disintegrates into Phish jazz, which spoils into cock-rock.
  5/28/94: Thick, stuttering tempo for Tweezer jam, Mike using heavy phaser, Trey and Page painting the high notes.
  5/28/94: Didn’t expect Bomb Factory-level experimentation from a festival Tweezer, but this one is moving through several different phases.
  5/28/94: Cartoony stretch (perhaps building off Trey’s Popeye tease earlier) around minute 10-11; then a big rock finish w/ a long sustain.
  5/28/94: Reba in consecutive shows and both second setters, that’s pretty unusual. Unusually crunchy, dark start to the jam.
  5/28/94: Very unique/awesome Reba, with storm clouds floating over and through the traditional jam. Even more emotionally rich than usual.
  5/28/94: As expected, Les Claypool shows up for a bass jam in YEM. Things are getting real slap-bassy up there.
  5/28/94: Now it’s dueling slap bass *and* vacuum. If you ever want a jam to scare someone off from Phish, this just might be it!
  5/28/94: On the other hand, it’s kind of fun hearing Trey play drums in the YEM jam.
  RT ‏@GuyForgetOPT I’m pretty sure many people would be surprised that there are times when Phish *doesn’t* have 2 slap-basses and a vacuum going.
  5/28/94: A rare set 2 “Don’t do anything we wouldn’t do,” and then a dueling banjos coda in lieu of vocal jam.
  5/28/94 Final: Low expectations for a festival set well surpassed. Set 2 Tweezer/Reba/Ice can hang with anything from the Warfield run.
