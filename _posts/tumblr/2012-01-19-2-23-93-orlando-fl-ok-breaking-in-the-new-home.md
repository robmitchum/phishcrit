2/23/93 - ORLANDO, FL
OK, breaking in the new home with 2/23/93, Orlando, FL, The Edge Night Club. Wasn’t in circulation in 2010. phishcrit.tumblr.com/post/356812397…
2/23/93: Glad that this show is no longer lost, but the sound quality is…colorful, to say the least. Like the GBV filter is on.
2/23/93: Forgot how intro-level the band’s first swing through FL was. The first 4 songs are like The Phish Singles Collection.
2/23/93: The over-saturation on this recording really gives Melt a nice, caustic edge. #AUDperks
2/23/93: A fuzzy recording might enhance a gnarled Melt; the Reba jam…not so much. Booming Mike bass bleeding all over any delicacy.
2/23/93: One perk of going back in time momentarily is another chance to hear the looser, jazzier arrangement of The Wedge.
2/23/93: Trey and Mike darting around each other throughout Antelope as if they know my mix is muddy. Thanks, dudes.
2/23/93: Interesting tease in the 3rd section of Antelope, but I can’t place it because of @phishnet blackout. #ObligatorySOPAtweet
2/23/93: Starting up Set II with Axilla. Oh, for the days when the entire band remembered what key this song is in… #cheapshot
2/23/93: What is it about Orlando and Stash? The last two minutes of this one are pretty next-level, before ripcording into Lizards.
2/23/93: Stash went into Lizards five times in February ‘93. Welcome back @phishnet. #funfacts
2/23/93: After a goofy prog-jazz interlude (PYITE > ATR), Mike’s sounds especially menacing. RIP second jam.
2/23/93: Weekapaug interrupted for the first ever Nellie Kane. Lots of bluegrass in this show, must be the influence of Rev. Jeff on 2/21.
2/23/93: The first Nellie Kane retains the Weekapaug tempo, making it a little peppier than subsequent versions. [Sorry, baby break]
2/23/93: Only about 4min of Weekapaug wrapped around Nellie and before >ing to HYHU. Lots of ideas packed in there though.
2/23/93: Paul Languedoc snags the only introduction in Terrapin.
2/23/93: Trey thanks crowd for “these wonderful mongrammed ears.” Guessing it’s a Disney thing.
2/23/93 verdict: Happy this show resurfaced, despite the spotty quality. No lost canonical jams, alas, but strong Antelope, Stash, ‘Paug.
