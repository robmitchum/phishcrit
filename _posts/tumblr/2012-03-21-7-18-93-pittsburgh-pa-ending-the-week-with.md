7/18/93 - PITTSBURGH, PA

Ending the week with 7/18/93, Pittsburgh, PA, IC Light Amphitheater. There was a venue named for Iron City Light beer?

7/18/93 Soundcheck: I gather this is the first known Guyute. Amusing to hear Page poking fun at Trey’s classicism by playing Bach over it.

7/18/93: 2nd soundchecked Pungee of the summer, then a Dude of Life megamix I wouldn’t have recognized if not for @bizarchive''s hard work.

7/18/93: Oh but @bizarchive the soundcheck’s “Train Medley” also contains “Mystery Train” starting at 0:44. Lot going on here.

RT @the_man_mulcahy: the venue was actually a gravel lot w/bench seats & a tiny stage. It was definitely not an amphitheater in the traditional sense.

7/18/93: Finally into the show proper with the ol’ classic Buried Alive > Rift opening pair and Foam. So ‘93 it hurts.

7/18/93: After dropping 58 different teases in the soundcheck, the actual show is very straightforward and songy. Decent Maze. Shrug.

7/18/93: Esther > Divided Sky was a big 25-minute slab of composition in the middle of the 1st set. Hard to recover.

7/18/93: 2001 streak goes up to 3. Some interesting space before the drums kick in. Time to 1st peak: 40s Time between peaks: 9s

7/18/93: 2001 > Poor Heart is quite the jump across genres. Impressive in theory.

7/18/93: Then out of nowhere, a 15-min+ Antelope with “Heartbreaker” teases, one of the “Hey” jamming games (?), fireworks, “Brother” jam

RT @the_man_mulcahy: Looking forward to ur thoughts on 2nd set. Note the Three Rivers fireworks during Antelope. Thought they were for PH at the time.

7/18/93: I don’t often comment on the ballads, but Trey’s solo in this FEFY feels especially spicy.

7/18/93: YEM jam is unhurried and sparse for a good, long stretch. Organ-led segment gives way to Trey micro-riffage.

7/18/93: A thought - they added a lot of humorous material for Summer ‘93, didn’t they? Purple Rain, Freebird, Daniel, even early 2001s.

7/18/93: Speaking of Purple Rain, Fish forgets most of the words on this night. #justbeinghonest #likeprincewouldhavemebe

7/18/93: Damn good low end on this vacuum solo though.

RT @the_man_mulcahy: The Purple Rain was nice surprise for sure. I also recall someone yelling “Freebird!” in the crowd and I thought it was a joke.

7/18/93: There has been a really serious bro conversation getting progressively louder in the left channel since the start of YEM. #AUDs

7/18/93 verdict: 4 shows into tour, the setlists are getting a little repetitious. But that’s one hell of an Antelope in the middle there.
