2/6/93 verdict: Interesting Mike’s Groove, but not much else. I do not like John Popper, in case you haven’t figured that out. 4/10.1:09 PM Sep 15th from web 
2/6/93: band kicks Mike out for Fire encore in favor of Hendrix’s bass player Noel Redding. But Popper’s still there to blow it (pun!).12:53 PM Sep 15th from web 
2/6/93: aw christ, john popper.12:37 PM Sep 15th from web  
2/6/93: very strange Mike’s; Mike dedicates his song to someone named Song, Trey sings a patch of something unidentifiable, some stop-starts11:37 AM Sep 15th from web 
2/6/93: tsk tsk, misbehaving audience for Sweet Adeline. sounds like they’re using a mic for the first time this tour though. #phish11:32 AM Sep 15th from web
