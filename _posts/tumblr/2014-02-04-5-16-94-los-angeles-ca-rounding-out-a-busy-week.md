  5/16/94 - LOS ANGELES, CA
  Rounding out a busy week with 5/16/94, Los Angeles, CA, Wiltern Theatre. Their only show at the Wiltern, and it has a reputation for mayhem.
  5/16/94: The soundcheck included Dog Log > the Smashing Pumpkins’ “Today”. Regrettably, it does not circulate.
  5/16/94: LA fans are really fired up to hear Sample for some reason. Clearly nobody there has been listening to every single show of tour.
  5/16/94: Just to rouse the rabble a little bit, does anyone else find the Divided Sky pause sort of…narcissistic?
  5/16/94: Haha, just looked at the average song gap for this show: 2.87.
  5/16/94: The final two minutes of Stash shakes a routine first set up; feints a switch to major, sculpts a nasty drone, and ends in a hush.
  5/16/94: How did Phish crowds never learn that Sweet Adeline doesn’t actually end at that one part?
  5/16/94: 4 minutes into Antelope, it steers in a dark, Mcgruppy direction, then jumps rhythmic tracks. We’re officially off.
  5/16/94: Some hints of BBFCFM 1 min before it fully emerges. Says something about the preceding jam that it’s actually a smooth segue.
  5/16/94: Only 1 verse of BBFCFM, and the ensuing section explores similar space to recent Ice breakdowns. Then Trey strikes a lighter path.
  5/16/94: Pretty triumphant section here, actually, though Page/Fish are slow to resolve the dark undercurrent and join in.
  5/16/94: 13 minutes in, Fish hits the reset button. Back on the Antelope climb, but still itchy, paranoid, fickle.
  5/16/94: Ha, good Trey flub in the 3rd Antelope section. Leads with the “set the gearshift” line, laughs, goes back to “rye rye rocco.”
  5/16/94: Speaking of Ice, here’s the third one in five shows, & another long one! Congeals into a Hey Bulldog-ish theme, brief vocal jam.
  5/16/94: More whistling in YEM…it’s a trend! Some additional gibberish from Fish over the composed part as well.
  5/16/94: YEM jam starts atypically with e-bowish lead from Trey and low bass rumbles. Darkness resolves in…a Louie Louie jam?
  5/16/94: I like these creepy low-murmur vocal jams more than the ones that just go wooooOOOOOoooohhhh for 5 minutes.
  5/16/94: Sorta disappointed that BBFCFM started over from the top instead of picking up where the mid-Antelope one left off.
  5/16/94: However, I do heartily endorse a no-mics Amazing Grace between verses of BBFCFM, and a lengthy noise jam when it comes back.

  5/16/94 Final: Expected more of a cohesive BBFCFM-fest, but the chaos was restricted to the beginning and end of set II. Massive Antelope.
