2/17/93 verdict: Big Bowie and YEM jams finally stretch limits two weeks into tour, but the rest of the show sticks to the script. 4.5/1012:03 PM Nov 13th from web 
2/17/93: Reggae-style Lengthwise slightly more tolerable than the largely acapella versions earlier in the tour. *Slightly*10:51 AM Nov 13th from web 
2/17/93: Teases galore in rad YEM jam: Mission Impossible from Page, Sunshine of Yr Love from everyone. Also: sneeze-based vocal jam.10:44 AM Nov 13th from web
2/17/93: The ambient section YEM is really strong, even this early; it’s a wonder it didn’t become a part of the improv arsenal until 98ish.10:24 AM Nov 13th from web
2/17/93: Set settled into a song-y run after that big Bowie; only notable aspect is the insanely fast tempo of this My Sweet One.10:17 AM Nov 13th from web 
2/17/93: Long Bowie intro for the time, with all the secret language cues and a creepy cartoonish melody; solid, patient jam too.10:00 AM Nov 13th from web 
2/17/93: Odd to have Landlady and Geulah in the rotation at the same time. Also, Landlady is the 3rd instrumental played this show.9:35 AM Nov 13th from web 
2/17/93: Strange, short blues jam before Trey calls out Axilla - there’s a weird mood to this show that I can’t quite put my finger on.9:30 AM Nov 13th from web
2/17/93: Trey before set break: “Most importantly, don’t believe everything you read!” Huh? Anyone know what that’s about? #phish2:46 PM Nov 12th from web
2/17/93: The trick for Maze - listen to everyone but the person soloing. Not as effective in ‘93, but works for newer versions.2:36 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: Usually underwhelmed by Fluffheads due to sameness, but Trey is doing some interesting drone stuff during the Page parts here.2:21 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: Woah, there is actually a weird 30-second overlap between It’s Ice and Bouncin’ - is this the only Type II Bouncin’ ever?2:05 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: Trey thanks the owners of Ziggy’s (3/26/92) for setting up the show. From a club to a convention center in one year, not bad.2:04 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: Five songs in before Trey takes his first lead vocal (The Sloth). I wonder what the record for that is? Phish sabermetrics.1:41 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: …and All Things Reconsidered - I guess they were in the mood for cartoony #phish instrumentals that night.1:35 PM Nov 12th from web 
2/17/93: Every show could start with Buried Alive, and I would be happy.1:30 PM Nov 12th from web  

 And you know what that means…#phish project show 12! 2/17/93 Winston-Salem, NC, Benton Convention Center. Smoke ‘em if you etc.1:21 PM Nov 12th from web
