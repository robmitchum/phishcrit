  4/8/94 - STATE COLLEGE, PA
  4/8/94, State College, PA, Recreation Hall, Penn State University. This one was part of my original tape collection: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-08 …
  4/8/94: First Maze opener since a couple shows in March ‘93. Surprised it isn’t used there more often, good way to limber up.
  4/8/94: This source is very crowd-heavy and they are PSYCHED. Should be an interesting angle on what has been a pretty sterile tour so far.
  4/8/94: Cymbal solo in I Didn’t Know, and “Greasy Fizeek” is now the preferred nomenclature. “Mimi Fizeek” also makes an appearance.
  4/8/94: Nice scratchy intro to PYITE, probably more due to rust than improvisational intent, but I’ll take it.
  4/8/94: Interesting Trey switch from acoustic to electric halfway through The Horse — due to crowd noise, or tech difficulties?
  4/8/94: We are now 3 for 4 on both Disease and If I Could on this young tour. Oddly, they’re usually both about the same length.
  4/8/94: Trey deploying the “Estimated Prophet”/Charlie Brown Teacher effect for his Lawn Boy solo. (belated #RSD-relevant tweet)
  4/8/94 second set will be delayed a bit due to lunch/work stuff. Meet me back here around 2 CDT.
  4/8/94: We’re back with a Fish scream and a Melt. Damn, good set openers in this show, and this one gets off to a dark, disorienting start.
  4/8/94: In fact, we have completely lost the three-note return in this Melt. Trey spiraling around Mike’s climbing bass, superb.
  4/8/94: This Melt reminds me a lot of the Big Cypress version, which I would not have said about any 93 Melt. More modern textures.
  4/8/94: Hooray, the digital delay loop pedal has officially arrived! Trey unspools a loop in the Ice breakdown and new space is discovered.
  4/8/94: Perhaps retreating from the interstellar possibilities of the DDL, It’s Ice quickly swerves into a bluesier (still excellent) jam.
  4/8/94: Damn, and now it sounds almost like a Melt reprise. A roller coaster 15-minute (!) It’s Ice, so much more than just the DDL jam.
  4/8/94: The crowd follows up that spectacular run with some absurdly off-time clapping over Sparkle. Shame on you, Nittany Lions.
  4/8/94: This loud bro conversation over Hood is a little bit too authentic a document of the live Phish experience.
  4/8/94: Hood jam twinkles into a dead end, but backs its way out and recovers for a thrilling, multi-peak finale. Again, very modern.
  4/8/94: Kind of disappointed that Big Ball Jam made it into the new year, but they’re playing with house money at this point, so.
  4/8/94: At least BBJ wasn’t followed by a Fish segment. Instead, a mostly linear, melodic Bowie with a few brief detours towards the end.
  4/8/94: Just in case you weren’t convinced the band was feeling this set, some bonus Zep and Yes teases thrown into Suzy.
  4/8/94: Another Contact > BBFCFM pairing for the encore, with plenty of Fish banter at/about his Mom.
  4/8/94 Final: What a fun 2nd set, which like a lot of well-known shows, provides a glimpse at the future. Could pass for anytime late 90s.
