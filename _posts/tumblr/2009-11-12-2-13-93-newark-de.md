2/13/93 verdict: Cookie-cutter early ‘93 setlist salvaged somewhat by solid playing. 4/10. Now to find a working stream for @bunnyradio…12:50 PM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: I’ve been ragging on Fish songs a lot during this project, but man, “Lengthwise” is just unlistenable. 9 minutes of nothing.12:34 PM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Percussive YEM jam gives way to a really nice bass-and-drums section, long vocal jam with “Lion Sleeps Tonight” teases.12:19 PM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: This Tweezer is getting farther afield than any I’ve heard thus far in ‘93 - Page’s piano keeping Trey out of his comfort zone.11:41 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Love Uncle Pen. Semi-related: I don’t think #fest8acoustic set will be bluegrass or TMWSIY; more like ‘96 “mini-stage.” yawn.11:31 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Old Runaway Jims, like this one, mostly run away in a straight line…one song where I’m looking forward to later expansion.11:19 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: The University of Delaware makes for really clappy crowds, it appears. #phish10:56 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Page: “for your own safety the aisles must be cleared, please help the ushers out here.” Trey: “this is our first Delaware gig.”10:46 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Stash is doing evil things to me as well; nasty, atonal soloing from Trey - I guess I just can’t shake the Halloween spirit.10:44 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Glad glad glad that “Glide” was in heavy rotation back then…how about we get the first 3.0 Glide at #fest8?10:31 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: Scary string-scrapes in the middle of “It’s Ice,” a very Halloween-appropriate song that, oddly, has never been played on Hween!10:25 AM Oct 29th from web 
2/13/93: David Bowie opener…could it be a #fest8 omen? Crazy way to start a show, evidence that they’ve warmed into mid-tour form.10:13 AM Oct 29th from web  

Too distracted by #fest8, might as well do #phish project, show 10: 2/13/93, Newark, DE, Bob Carpenter Center. Home of the Blue Hens!10:03 AM Oct 29th from web
