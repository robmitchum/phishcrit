  5/25/94 - SAN FRANCISCO, CA
  Starting up a 5-night Northern California residency with 5/25/94, San Francisco, CA, Warfield Theatre. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-25/ …
  5/25/94: The Warfield is a nice case study in Phish’s iterative success. One show in 92, two in 93, three in 94.
  5/25/94: The Warfield run kicks off with a yin-yang pairing of Curtain > Sample. 3 of the 5 Curtains in 94 so far have dropped into Sample.
  5/25/94: Grinding theme at the start of Stash somehow morphs into a Trey/Mike Uncle Pen tease. #spookygrass
  5/25/94: First Forbin’s > Mock in 23 shows and just over a month. Only one Harpua in that span too. Narration is fading.
  5/25/94: Narration finds crowd forming into a clay lump of “human energy goo” and slingshot (w/ A+ fx) into space/Gamehendge.
  5/25/94: I think Axilla II’s current setlist role is to show up when the band just needs to yell.
  5/25/94: Page’s melodica solo in the acoustic My Sweet One is now some kind of melodica/Madonna washboard duel.
  5/25/94: Always fun when they put a random chord at the end of a song that doesn’t really work as a set closer (here, Chalk Dust).
  5/25/94: Guy yelling at tapers at start of set break - “Everybody over there taping needs to lower their speakers about a foot and a half.”
  5/25/94: Slowly developing pattern in the Tweezer jam. Intricate maneuvers over a steady rhythmic base. The opposite of ADD jamming.
  5/25/94: In fact, I don’t think we’ve had a real exploratory, multi-segmented jam since…Bomb Factory? Maybe the 5/20 Ice?
  5/25/94: For those keeping track, I’m still not won over by Lifeboy. Putting it after every single Tweezer is a real momentum killer.
  5/25/94: After ballad time, some of the punch of another insane Maze is lost, despite the now-routine sonic sculpting from Trey.
  5/25/94: Julius is already the fifth Hoist song we’ve heard in the first show of the run, which makes me think we’ll get some repeats.
  5/25/94: Maybe he does it all the time, but I just noticed Page multi-tasking piano and organ in this Julius. Is there a term for that?
  5/25/94: The Syd Barrett catalog goes back on the shelf in favor of “Purple Rain,” which sounds a little sleepy. A repeat from Greek ’93.
  5/25/94: Page’s Coil solo breaches the five-minute mark, but still isn’t doing much new. To be fair, few sane people listen to all of them.
  5/25/94: Fishman’s biggest fan keeps yelling out his name during quiet parts. With a Sleeping Monkey encore, Jon *is* keeping pretty busy.
  5/25/94 Final: Very “1st show of run.” Could have ignited after Tweezer, but instead fell back to ballads, novelty, and Hoist plugging.
