8/9/93 - TORONTO, ON
Ready steady go for 8/9/93, Toronto, ON, Concert Hall. Their second time at the venue in less than 4 months (prev: http://rob-mitchum.tumblr.com/post/4397991759/4-27-93-toronto-on-here-begins-phish-project …)
8/9/93: And because this is Aug ‘93, we have achieved awesome status a mere 3 minutes in, courtesy of a Band of Gypsys jam inside Chalkdust.
8/9/93: Fitting for Phish to play in a Masonic Temple; Freemasons are one of few groups with as much convoluted mythology as Phish fans.
8/9/93: Neat one-minute mini-jam at the end of Fee, an appropriately nightmareish lead-in to Melt.
8/9/93: This Melt simply could not wait to get off the usual path. Jamming before the vocals were done, now herk-jerk madness.
8/9/93: Trey is playing in a completely different rhythm than the other three, and it alternates between sounding awesomely weird and awful.
8/9/93: This gradual tempo slow down in Melt is technically impressive but almost viscerally nauseating.
8/9/93: Honestly can’t say whether I liked that Melt or not, but it definitely redefined what was possible in that song’s jam.
8/9/93: Every song so far - even Glide and Mound - has done something unusual at some point. They’re in a playful mood.
8/9/93: Just to prove my point, they played a little snippet of Nellie Kane *in the Divided Sky pause*. Blasphemy?
8/9/93: Never much to say about a Divided Sky, but they seemed to attack this one with extra relish. Some piercing drones from Trey.
8/9/93: Because nothing else is by the book this set, they do an acapella number (Memories) in the middle. At least the crowd is less drunk.
8/9/93: Fantastic pre-solo Coil jam (shades of McGrupp) caps off a set with little moments of creativity sprinkled everywhere.
8/9/93: 33 shows since the last Dinner and a Movie, already a rarity. Already rusty too, the middle is a mess. #flubs
8/9/93: Tweezer starts with a more patiently developed and arena-rocky theme than usual for the era, feels very modern.
8/9/93: Sounded like Tweezer was gonna do its slow disintegration thing, but now we are in bonus nightmare fuel territory.
8/9/93: Tela graces us with her breezy presence for the first time this summer. Much needed after that thorny Tweezer segment.
8/9/93: Tela outro is briefly acoustic as Trey swaps guitars for MFMF. #hijinks
8/9/93: Bass teases of Nellie Kane all over YEM, and another unusual stretch post-tramps. Bendy notes and stop-starts beneath Page’s organ.
8/9/93: Is the resemblance of the Speed Racer theme and “Smoke on the Water” also in The Book, like SOTW/Cat Scratch Fever? (cf 7/18/99)
8/9/93: Surprisingly thorough rendition of Psycho Killer in the vocal jam brings this YEM close to 3/14/93 levels of teasiness.
8/9/93: That’s two YEMs in a row that have somehow found a way to -> their way out of the vocal jam. Impressively morphed into Contact.
8/9/93: Wow, The Dude of Life gets one hell of an intro. Thought it was going to be BBFCFM at first.
8/9/93 verdict: Like 8/7, doesn’t take a set or even a song off. Even better than it looks on paper, w/ lots going on in Melt, YEM, Tweezer.
