  5/6/94 - HOUSTON, TX
  Half a show for the mid-holidays. 5/6/94, Houston, TX, Tower Theater. Set I does not circulate. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-06 …
  5/6/94: Bummer that this is the first incomplete show of 94, but not too chuffed to miss the first set, which looks like Stash + filler.
  5/6/94: Very boomy recording too, which actually sorta fits Maze well. Page sounds like a prisoner to his own solo, under assault.
  5/6/94: The Trey section was also great in Maze, though it wasn’t so much a solo as a harmonic groan. A real paranoiac version all around.
  5/6/94: The Golgi makes it clear that this recording also has tape speed issues, which is *perfect* for a Houston show. #drank
  5/6/94: Said tape issues may be to blame, but they sound gassed. Flubs all over Golgi and Uncle Pen, no jam vehicles in sight.
  5/6/94: Of course the show missing the first set is the first second-set Sample in 7 plays.
  5/6/94: AUD accentuates the soupy wash of the Reba jam’s origin while Trey keeps his phrasing terse. The peak stabs through the boom-gloom.
  5/6/94: Axilla II > Julius, both repeats from the last show (along with Sample). Hoist, on Elektra Records, in stores now!
  5/6/94: Oh nice, Bike shakes up the tired setlist considerably. First one since 8/2/93, thanks to Purple Rain and I Wanna Be Like You.
  5/6/94: Some bonus HYHU jamming in the Bowie intro, as well as some secret language, which clearly has not made its way down to Texas.
  5/6/94: Heavy, heavy Bowie jam, touching on a big, windmilling chord progression straight out of recent Mike’s Songs.
  5/6/94: Nice ending to the Bowie too, with the band layering a King Crimsony pattern into the traditional finish. The crowd seems stunned.

  5/6/94 Final: The heavy AUD atmosphere gifts them a menacing lumber they didn’t really sport in early 94, and suits Maze, Bowie just fine.
