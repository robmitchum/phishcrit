7/29/93 - KNOXVILLE, TN
To wit, here begins 7/29/93, Knoxville, TN, Tennessee Theatre. Westward ho.
7/29/93: Appropriately enough for a very bass-heavy recording, the show opens with the 1st/only Funky Bitch of the summer.
7/29/93: Playing at the Tennessee Theatre in 2012: Jane’s Addiction, Styx, Alice Cooper, Bush, Shinedown, the Nuge.
7/29/93: No real segues, but barely any pause between songs. Lots of energy, even as they do a little newish-LP promo (Weigh, Rift, FEFY).
7/29/93: Co-pilot @misterajp drew up the approximate mic placement on this recording source: http://yfrog.com/obn01ep
7/29/93: The summer’s first Forbin’s brings a very laid-back Trey’s transcendental meditation guide + pretty standard Gamehendge tourism.
7/29/93: Possum is the 4th (!) Mike vocal of the set, and it seriously cooks. Quiet harmonics (w/ indoor firework?) stoked up to a blaze.
7/29/93: One of my favorite spooky Phish tricks - barely audible whispering - pops up in the Maze intro. Let’s get dark in Set II.
7/29/93: Another solid Maze, unhinged in all the right ways. And then a slightly off-script Bouncin’?! Maybe the ‘93 magic is arriving…
7/29/93: Page with some jazzy James Bond Theme teases on both organ and piano in the spacey middle of It’s Ice. @bizarchive
7/29/93: OK I know we are in Tennessee, but yelling “YEEE-HAA!” might be the most inappropriate possible audience response to Lifeboy.
7/29/93: Heavy metal YEM! Entire band locks into repeated three-note riff, surrounded by Fish power-fills. Pops back up in vocal jam.
7/29/93: There is a dude slurringly chanting for “Contact” as the band stands at their acapella mic. #drugs
7/29/93 verdict: A less frustrating show despite minimal jamming. Deceptively dark in spots, dialed-in throughout. Possum, YEM, Maze recc’d.
