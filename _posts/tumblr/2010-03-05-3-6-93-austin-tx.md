3/6/93 verdict: Woah, brah, what’s with the negative vibes? They work for Tweezer and nothing else. Never heard Phish heckled before. 2.5/101:06 PM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: OH during “Sweet Adeline” - Woman: “They’re a goddamn barbershop quartet and I don’t want to hear it!” Man: “Hey, shut up!”12:53 PM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: (Another Phish essay idea: shows where they say “fuck.” Exile costume probably set the record.)12:45 PM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: Show veers back into strangely angry place for Phish w/ F-bomb in “Cracklin’ Rosie” and mean-spirited BBFCFM.12:42 PM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: YEM flails between a couple themes, nothing really sticks. Long Mike solo, teasing something…P-Funk? 7-min vocal jam a bit much.12:31 PM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: Tweezer darkness dispelled somewhat by soothing Reba that gets quiet enough to reveal bar-noise.11:56 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck
3/6/93: Evil Tweezer jam finds Trey doing manual proto-digiloops, sustain alternating with feedback waves. Noisy threads throughout.11:38 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck
3/6/93: Cookie-cutter Runaway Jim ends a set of mostly radio Phish. Higher hopes for the second frame, based off setlist.11:22 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: Re: road-trip rustiness, what sadist booked their tours in ‘93? They went from FL to LA to TX to CO in 10 days.11:00 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: A rare (for this era) near-collapse in Mound and a limper-than-usual PYITE (though Landlady flies). Sounding a bit rusty so far.10:56 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck 
3/6/93: Curtain > Melt segue awesome in theory, clunky in practice. Melt is jazzy, almost mellow in the middle, gets noisy but never clicks.10:43 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck
While everyone else listens to Joanna Newsom, here’s #phishproject show 24: 3/6/93, Austin, TX, Liberty Lunch. Oh no, 3hrs of music! Waahhh10:23 AM Feb 23rd via TweetDeck
