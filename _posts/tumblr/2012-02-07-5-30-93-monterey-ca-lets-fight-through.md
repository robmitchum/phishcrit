5/30/93 - MONTEREY, CA
Let’s fight through 5/30/93, Monterey, CA, Laguna Seca Daze Part II. Sharing the bill this night with 10,000 Maniacs and Big Head Todd.
5/30/93: The set-opening Lengthwise is missing. If it was the reggae version, I can’t fault the taper for his editorial decision.
5/30/93: Someone is singing along to Page’s Maze solo - either Trey is messing with him, or Page is doing a Keith Jarrett tic.
5/30/93: This set feels looser than the previous day, in both flubby and playful ways. Wonder what the attendance was like at this fest.
5/30/93: Weird, a Horse-less Silent, for the first time ever according to @phishnet. Maybe the airline lost Trey’s acoustic guitar.
5/30/93: Nice mellow slide between Silent and Antelope, which is an enjoyably competent version. Faint praise might be the high water mark.
5/30/93: Ya Mar might have been the most interesting setlist call of the Laguna sets, which says a lot. Quality Leo time.
5/30/93: Split keeps shifting keys in a really disorienting way. It’s not a bad trick, but I’m glad it didn’t stick around.
5/30/93: If they hadn’t already burned Coil the night before, it would fit right into this Page-centric set. Lotta Chairman solos here.
5/30/93: I would be happy to never hear “LA Woman” again, but the riff sounds all right embedded in the middle of Possum.
5/30/93 verdict: Slightly better flow and attitude than the previous night, but still a forgettable festie set. On to Summer ‘93!
