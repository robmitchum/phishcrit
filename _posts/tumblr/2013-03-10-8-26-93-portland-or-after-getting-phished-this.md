  8/26/93: PORTLAND, OR 
  After getting Phished this morning, might as well listen to some Phish. 8/26/93, Portland, OR, Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall.
  8/26/93: Wikipedia says this venue is known locally as “The Schnitz.” Jim breakdown filled with proto-plinko jamming and string scrapes.
  8/26/93: Jim jam swerves off the usual ascent, touches briefly on “Gypsy Queen” before finding a more original detour.
  8/26/93: Ha, Trey calls back to their April Fool’s joke (also in Portland) with a fake introduction of Neil Young in Guelah.
  8/26/93: Another incongruous Dixie tease (all north of the Mason-Dixon) to start the Reba jam.
  8/26/93: Out of a near-silent jam comes a pretty, subdued theme explored for a bit before jumping back on the Reba progression.
  8/26/93: Hooray, post-Fee jam! Doesn’t bliss out in ambient as usual, but ups the tempo on a busy full-band riff. All too brief.
  8/26/93: Both the quiet theme in Reba and that post-Fee jam could have been explored much further. Rip(cord) City.
  8/26/93: This Melt started out ready to rock, but decided instead to explore some eeeevil territories. Killing it, almost literally.
  8/26/93: And wow, even the return to the Melt jam theme is frightening, with some unexpected key shifts layered in.
  8/26/93: Standing O for that Melt. One of those versions where you’re not sure how they’ll make it back.
  8/26/93: Keeping the Halloween in August vibes going with Esther. #dollmurder
  8/26/93: The creepiness continues with a long, piano-clank It’s Ice breakdown that is positively…chilling. #evillaughter
  8/26/93: I know this is getting repetitive, but even the Hood intro (first set Hood?) is evil as fuck. Mike: BWOM BWOM BWOM BWOM.
  8/26/93: Finally, the Hood jam offers a safe path out of the darkness. Some nice themes patiently developed, excellent, driving peak.
  8/26/93: It has somehow been 4 shows since the last 2001! I guess the band finally forgave Kuroda for whatever he did in Morrison.
  8/26/93: Bowie jam perseverating hard on a spiraling riff, coasting on the fumes of the first set’s evil. 99 parts tension, 1 part release.
  8/26/93: Lot of heavy distortion from Trey in this show, very uncharacteristic of the ‘93 clean sound days.
  8/26/93: After about 20 Bowie jam endings, Lifeboy shows up. I suppose this show was in need of an exorcism.
  8/26/93: This Rift is incredibly fast, almost uncomfortably so. And still played near flawlessly. Shows what a year with 100+ shows can do.
  8/26/93: Page really selling it on this Jesus Just Left Chicago. Putting a little extra phlegm to work.
  8/26/93: No clapping allowed over the end of Lizards, Portland.
  8/26/93: Fish makes Neil Young callback joke #2, and gives over his slot to Baby Gramps. Throat singing and vacuum. It’s…unique.
  8/26/93: This show spent all its jamming capital early, and hasn’t done much post-Bowie. Closing up shop with a standard Chalkdust.
  8/26/93 verdict: The dream of the 90s was alive in Portland…and it was a NIGHTMARE, mwahaha. Great 1st set, especially the Melt.
