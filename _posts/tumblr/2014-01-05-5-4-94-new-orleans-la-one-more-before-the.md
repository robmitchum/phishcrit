  5/4/94 - NEW ORLEANS, LA
  One more before the holidays. 5/4/94, New Orleans, LA, State Palace Theatre. Six cosmic horns a-blowing. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-04/ …
  5/4/94: Due in part to damage from Hurricane Katrina, the State Palace Theatre closed in 2007 and hasn’t reopened: http://afterthefinalcurtain.net/2013/10/16/loews-state-theatre-state-palace-theatre/ …
  5/4/94: War between the rowdies and shushers breaks out during the quiet jam of Foam, if anything inspiring the band to stretch it out.
  5/4/94: Hard to think of a more generic ’94 opening than Jim > Foam, Sample.
  5/4/94: Free jazz parentheses bracket a heavy-wah blues swing and an electric-Miles tease (“Right Off”) in the It’s Ice breakdown.
  5/4/94: Sparkle and Axilla II feed their need for speed. Then the first Tweezer in, wow, 10 shows, can that be right?
  5/4/94: Also an extremely rare for the era first-set Tweezer. Only other one I’ve heard in the project was 2/18/93.
  5/4/94: Violently discordant Tweezer jam, power chord hammers over a seasick rhythm, resolves to blues-rock. Many themes, not all pleasant.
  5/4/94: That Tweezer was the first real ADD-style jam since the 4/24 Gin, but didn’t really hint at the madness that awaits in the next.
  5/4/94: We’re on night 4 of the six-show Sample streak, but Rift has also been played twice in a row and 3 of the last 4.
  5/4/94: Tweeprise ends the *first* set, only two songs removed from its ancestor. Maybe because they forgot it last time (4/22).
  5/4/94: Pretty standard Antelope jam, which is then dedicated to the new baby of Trey’s friend. Sorry baby, you’re pretty standard.
  5/4/94: The Cosmic Country Horns make their entrance during the YEM tramps. No tramps sub announced for Trey, is the ankle better?
  5/4/94: No vocal jam in the (under 11 minutes!) YEM, for the second time in a row. They weren’t trying to phase it out, were they?
  5/4/94: Other than the YEM entrance, the 3rd horns set of the tour starts out exactly like the 1st on 4/4 — Buried Alive, Landlady, Julius.
  5/4/94: I don’t have enough of an ear for brass to compare GCH vs. CCH, but I do like the low end the bari sax is adding to this Julius.
  5/4/94: Oh hey, this Wolfman’s has the same sped-up Alumni Blues jam as the 4/15 version, just w/ no vocals.
  5/4/94: Nice Michael Ray/Fishman trade-off at the end of Magilla. The 6th Magilla this tour…and last until 1997. Farewell, gorilla.
  5/4/94: Cool stretch of Suzy around 4:00 when the rhythmic bottom drops out. Definitely the most cosmic moment of this CCH appearance.
  5/4/94: Mike using an electric tool on his bass during Caravan like it’s 2013.
  5/4/94 Final: A bit redundant to the other horns sets of tour, even with different personnel. But Caravan and a weird Tweezer stand out.
