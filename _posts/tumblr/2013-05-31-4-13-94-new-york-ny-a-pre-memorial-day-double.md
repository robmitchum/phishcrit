  4/13/94 - NEW YORK, NY
  A pre-Memorial Day double feature today (sort of). 4/13/94a, New York, NY, WNEW Studios. Promoting a record on the radio, how quaint!
  4/13/94a: DJ says the 3 Beacon shows sold out in 34 minutes. “33-1/3,” Trey corrects.
  4/13/94a: Wiki says WNEW is now WWFS, which plays “hot adult contemporary.” Coincidentally, Phish also now plays “hot adult contemporary.”
  4/13/94a: Radio session mix as wacked as usual. Loud, echoey drums, no bass, electric piano. But it’s just Sample, so whatever.
  4/13/94a: “Snapple in a Jar” would actually have been a pretty good jingle, if Trey’s story is true.
  4/13/94a: Of course Phish would use a radio appearance to yell nonsense over/forget the words to Disease, the video single.
  4/13/94a: DJ drops the Zappa comparison instead of the G———- D—-. Good work!
  4/13/94a: Rift is a pretty silly song to play on the radio, which I think the band recognizes as they crack up over the first line.
  4/13/94a Final: If they’ve gotta pimp the album for the record company man, at least their sense of humor is intact.

  Part 2 of today’s double feature: 4/13/94, New York, NY, Beacon Theatre. Think of this run as the prequel to Hands on a Hardbody.
  4/13/94: Trey’s “laser gun” effect back for Buried Alive, and a noisier attempt in the intro to Stash. Anyone know how it’s done?
  RT ‏@netw3rk @phishcrit Guessing, but Digitech Whammy pedal, original version.
  4/13/94: Just when I thought this Stash was pretty standard, there’s a spooky CYHMK jam towards the end. Very cool.
  4/13/94: I don’t mind this Julius, actually. Beats the Hoist version that was oddly played in the middle of their WNEW set.
  4/13/94: Trey says he wanted to play the Beacon ever since he saw *The Residents* there. #NoisePhish
  4/13/94: No mics Ginseng, with — I believe — Page on melodica? First time I’ve heard him use one.
  4/13/94: Theatre crowds appear less likely to go nuts during the Divided Sky pause, leading to a shorter pause. Kind of a relief?
  4/13/94: This Guitar magazine article from 1994 appears to confirm Page melodica as part of the acoustic setup: http://www.phisharchive.com/articles/1994/treyguitar.html …
  4/13/94: The 8th different 2nd set opener in 8 shows is Faht…they seem to really be enjoying the acoustics/quiet of the theatre.
  4/13/94: Curtain > Sample was a cruel move. But Reba restores the weirdness and promises the first significant improv since Stash.
  4/13/94: Very patient and mellow Trey/Mike dialogue at the outset of Reba jam, in no great hurry to build in volume or pace.
  4/13/94: That Reba was a full package, even some secret language thrown in. Now they’re playing with beach balls in a Broadway theatre.
  4/13/94: Page totally ripcords any potential Fee outro jam with the Take the A-Train piano riff, but I’ll allow it. Good New York nod.
  4/13/94: Aw, and this is the last ever Take the A Train, unless there’s a Johnny B. Fishman Jazz Ensemble reunion tour someday. Bummer.
  4/13/94: A Train and Reba teases to kick off the Bowie jam. I like when Bowie is a digest of the preceding set, see also 8/2/98.
  4/13/94: Great stop/start segment, sort of Pink Panther-ish. Strong momentum throughout, even in the abstract parts. Kind of a clumsy peak.
  4/13/94: Great Bowie though, the first 94 take that makes the landmark UIC version (only two months from now!) seem possible.
  4/13/94: First Purple Rain of 94 finds Page on the Rhodes for the verses…gives it a little more 80s synthenticity.
  4/13/94: Nice taut AC/DC Bag to round out the set. More stop/start in the jam, quick “Sunshine of Your Love” call-back to 4/11.
  4/13/94: Got both a “Let’s Go Rangers” and a “Baba Booey” in the shushfest preceding “Sweet Adeline.” The NYC Double.
  4/13/94 Final: Decently weird show that eventually found its way to quality improv in the second frame. Bowie and Reba both strong.
