8/3/93 - MIAMI, FL
Special Sunday edition to get back on track: 8/3/93, Miami, FL, Bayfront Park Amphitheater. Let’s see how the 8/2 momentum carried over. 
8/3/93: Editor’s note - This will be the first Phishcrit review performed while cleaning out my pet turtle’s tank. 
8/3/93: Jim starting in the midst of the jam’s peak is a tape error, but feels appropriate after the previous night’s relentless approach. 
8/3/93: Nellie Kane barges into the middle of frequent companions Jim and Foam. Like 7/31, Foam solos atypically creative, patient. 
8/3/93: Some weirdness - Trey forgot the megaphone for the first verse of Fee, Page did a solo “random note” secret language. 
8/3/93: Better weirdness - Stash jams drops immediately into devious lock-step Trey/Mike riffing, peaks with Buried Alive-ish mania. 
8/3/93: Rest of the opening set is standard summer fare, Ya Mar included. Little extra air-raid spice in the Llama solo. 
8/3/93: There’s your last classic Lengthwise &gt; Maze set opener for a while. Gone until 10/20/94. 
8/3/93: It’s Ice is less spacey than sloppy. Nice Munsters shoutout by Page though. 
8/3/93: Maybe they were just saving that Space for YEM, which swims longer than usual in the ambient section. 
8/3/93: YEM jam is a great example of the band finding a theme (generic funk lick) then de/re-constructing it for several minutes. 
8/3/93: Makisupa Policeman teases in the vocal jam starting around 17:20. cc @bizarchive 
8/3/93: Was “Purple Rain” the first Fish song that didn’t require a HYHU lead-in? 
8/3/93: “Purple Rain” is also different from other Fish songs in that he actually tries to play notes on the vacuum. Emphasis on “tries.” 
8/3/93 verdict: Despite the 8 in the month slot, a pretty average 93 show. Fierce but sloppy throughout, with good moments in Stash, YEM.
