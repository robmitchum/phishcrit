3/31/93 - PORTLAND, OR

As promised, it’s time for #phish project show 40: 3/31/93, Portland, OR, Roseland Theater. The first night of a two-show run. 12:27 PM Sep 7th via TweetDeck
3/31/93: Runaway Jim, Foam, Sparkle - the Tinker to Evers to Chance of ‘93 setlists. September 7, 2010 12:46:03 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93: Melt takes a step back after recent trend toward deep explorations; this one’s short, Trey-focused, stays on the path. September 7, 2010 1:06:37 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
3/31/93: Impressive that the crowd already has the Mound clap down only 3 months after Rift’s release. September 7, 2010 1:11:36 PM CDT via TweetDeck
Yep, that’s the plan. RT @Poster_Nutbag: @robmitchum new follower (WaPo). do you livetweet as you listen? September 7, 2010 1:15:30 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  .@phish83 Going through in chronological order, started in Feb. 93. Explained here: http://bit.ly/9FLDYB #phish September 7, 2010 1:24:51 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93: Solid, if unremarkable Reba - band’s stuck in first gear this set. Madonna washboard instead of vacuum for I Didn’t Know. September 7, 2010 1:37:35 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93: Much better on Bowie - cool intro with everyone going pizzicato, jam on a theme I can’t place, creative twist in the peak. September 7, 2010 1:58:35 PM CDT via TweetDeck
We will now pause for setbreak while I cross my fingers and check my Gmail every 2 seconds. #phish September 7, 2010 2:02:02 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93 Set II suspended until tomorrow on account of #ptbm failure and depression. September 7, 2010 3:51:25 PM CDT via TweetDeck
OK, I think I am sufficiently recovered from my #ptbm shutout to finish 3/31/93. Though if anyone wants to offer me AC or Charleston tix… September 8, 2010 1:24:45 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/31/93: The first ever live Lengthwise > Maze transition, as was most recently heard, well, 2 shows ago. The Jones Beach one was better. September 8, 2010 1:29:08 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
3/31/93: Very odd early 2nd set placement for Hood - intro toys around with the Pink Panther theme, jam is patient but a little aimless. September 8, 2010 1:57:24 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93: I do, however, miss the emphatic “I FEEL GOOD!” at the end of Hoods. Wonder when that ended. September 8, 2010 1:59:35 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
3/31/93: A rather generously tracked “Jam” on this download that runs a full 39 seconds. More of a bridge from Ice to YEM, really. September 8, 2010 2:14:11 PM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/31/93: When the jams underwhelm, tell a story - “Harpua” takes over, with Beverly Hills Cop and “She’s So Cold” themes. September 8, 2010 2:46:22 PM CDT via TweetDeck 
  3/31/93: Trey urging audience to stalk Bonnie Raitt (also playing in PDX) and convince her to jam with them. “I have a big crush on her.” September 8, 2010 3:07:00 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/31/93 verdict: A standard, reined-in show other than a well-planned Harpua and a B+ Bowie. But maybe I’m just grumpy about tickets. September 8, 2010 3:21:38 PM CDT via TweetDeck
