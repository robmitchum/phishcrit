  4/14/94 - NEW YORK, NY
  4/14/94, New York, NY, Beacon Theatre. We’re safely back on PhishTracks, if you want to play along at home: http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-04-14 …
  4/14/94: It occurs to me that this is only the second 3-night run in the project, after Roxy ‘93. Definitely nothing that crazy so far.
  4/14/94: JimFoamSparkle about as standard an opening as you can get for this era. Disease seems to have sped up to modern tempo.
  4/14/94: Na-na-na backing vocals at the end of Disease appear to be fading out as well. Those didn’t last long.
  4/14/94: Pretty sloppy Rift, followed by the 2nd-ever Demand, which sounds sloppy even when it’s played correctly.
  4/14/94: Demand > Melt is a nice nod to Hoist. Decent Melt jam, nothing unusual. Guy screaming for “Tube” afterwards may be time traveler.
  4/14/94: The Page solo at the end of Coil is really stretching out, and I love it. This one’s ~5 minutes, ft. a clever Foam tease at 9:15.
  4/14/94: 2001 kicks off set 2 for the 2nd time in 3 shows, so it may be back for good. Crowd on point for secret language in Antelope intro.
  4/14/94: Twisty, intense 2nd segment of Antelope gives way to an extra-dubby 3rd. Page steering the band more than usual.
  4/14/94: Even pre-Mule Duel, SOAMule can’t really find a good spot in a set. Here it’s a decent energy boost after a Horse > Silent.
  4/14/94: Trey recruits an audience member to do the tramps routine. Sounds like a liability nightmare.
  4/14/94: “Nice attempt, maybe next time.” So that went about as well as I would have predicted, I guess.
  4/14/94: I’m surprised more YEM vocal jams don’t end in laughter and an awkward “OK”.
  4/14/94: The debut of Dog-Faced Boy was in the acoustic/no-mics setup? I didn’t know that. I assume it’s interesting, can barely hear it.
  4/14/94: Just from the way Trey attacks the “heavy” part of Slave, it doesn’t sound like a dusty bustout any more.
  4/14/94: Trey trend I’m picking up on this year is layering - both DDL & segments where it sounds like he’s rhythm and lead simultaneously.

  4/14/94 Final: Predictable old-school setlist and prolonged no-mics make for an inconsistent show. Coil solo & Slave are the highlights.
