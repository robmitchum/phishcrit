  12/30/93 – PORTLAND, ME
  Time for a good one. 12/30/93, Portland, ME, Cumberland County Civic Center. Audible crowd chant for “Slave” as the band comes out.
  12/30/93: First Bowie opener we’ve heard since a couple Feb shows. A real agenda-setter of an opener, even if they rush the intro.
  12/30/93: The way everyone locks into the “Dream On” tease immediately is some A+ band communication (even if they sdchecked it on the 28th)
  12/30/93: Great SBD mix on this show, which surely helped its legend status. Awesome thwack to the snare, cracking the whip.
  12/30/93: The amount of travel on this run (DC > CT > ME > MA) is kinda nuts. Nearly 700 miles over 4 days in winter?
  RT @neddyo @phishcrit drive from NH to Portland was literally in a snowstorm. Drove past jackknived tractor trailers through the night
  12/30/93: Been a long time since the last Curtain (23 shows). Last played at the Cincy Zoo show. Foreshadowing?
  12/30/93: Curtain landing in Sample is a serious ice-cold shower though, for real.
  12/30/93: Fans cheering for the “Forbin” mention of Icculus and Trey laughing at people cheering was already present at this time, FYI.
  12/30/93: Forbin’s narration references the wait in the cold, hockey ice logistics, floor vibrations, plywood surfboards, huge waves.
  12/30/93: Thing Forbin’s narration did not reference: the giant prop aquarium they’ve been playing in for three shows now.
  12/30/93: I think the Mockingbird flew at full speed into a window there at the start. Dusted itself off, back in flight.
  12/30/93: Some sweet out-of-phase vocals and drums happening on this tape now for Gin. Almost as trippy as this: https://soundcloud.com/rc428/side-1-x-100 …
  12/30/93: Gin tinkers with tempo, upshifting to manic curlicues then lurching to a lumbering finish. Not exactly graceful, but cool.
  12/30/93: Oof, this Freebird is awful. Page must’ve forgotten his pitch pipe.
  12/30/93: Yeah, that drum sound I talked about? Makes this short 2001 sound extra sweet. Turns out this source is a matrix, makes sense.
  12/30/93: Unusually triumphant (Weekapaugish) theme in the second jam of Mike’s, relief from the edgy claustrophobia of the first jam.
  12/30/93: Wow, the last few minutes of Mike’s. A pretzeled bassline morphed into a massive chord progression. If anything, too short.
  12/30/93: Page has a cold. Phlegmy in the morning.
  12/30/93: Glad they’re taking their time closing this Mike’s Groove, and great placement of PYITE. Mike’s super-high bass part sounds CRAZY.
  12/30/93: McGrupp solidifies this one as a show for the diehards. I guess you’d have to be a diehard to go to Portland, ME in December.
  12/30/93: Weekapaug doesn’t go on much of a journey, but lands for the closing verse in a delightfully itchy groove complete w/ vocal jam.
  12/30/93: It must have been pretty exciting for the crowd to see their “Slave” chant work. Response is strangely subdued on the tape though.
  12/30/93: Best Slave jams are the ones that revel and seethe in the repetition, instead of trying to shred too fast. This is up there.
  12/30/93: The last few GTBTs have all contained some really interesting thematic playing from Trey instead of straight solos. Weird.
  12/30/93 verdict: The secret sauce (other than a great matrix and some quality bustouts) is the architecture of set 2. They nailed it.
