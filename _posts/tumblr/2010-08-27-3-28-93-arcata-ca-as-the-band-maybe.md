3/28/93 - ARCATA, CA

As the band (maybe) rehearses only miles away, #phish project show 38: 3/28/93, Arcata, CA, Humboldt State University. Last CA show. June 8, 2010 10:28:49 AM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/28/93: Appropriately, phishows.com source opens with soundcheck - A Wedge jam and a 16-min Dog Log. As usual, empty room gets lucky. June 8, 2010 10:44:59 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/28/93: First interesting move of show is a Melt with a different approach: launches mellow and finds a strange, Riftish Mike bassline. June 8, 2010 11:32:36 AM CDT via TweetDeck
3/28/93: There’s some great Leslie speaker whirling detectable on this soundboard in Maze. Whee, stereo separation. June 8, 2010 11:34:10 AM CDT via TweetDeck
  3/28/93: Antelope has goofy Andy Griffith and Beverly Hills Cop themes, then gets scary/modern in the middle stretch. Era-straddler. June 8, 2010 12:25:34 PM CDT via TweetDeck
@Chaakles I feel like I’ve heard them tease it before too, but I’m drawing a blank. This show’s soundcheck had an even longer Axel F jam. June 8, 2010 12:39:38 PM CDT via TweetDeck in reply to Chaakles
   3/28/93: A rare ‘93 Gin, and a dud. I see why it was temporarily retired. June 8, 2010 12:53:07 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/28/93: YEM is paused for only performance ever of creepy “My Life as a Pez,” written by Trey’s friend Dave Abrahams: http://bit.ly/dnzueW June 8, 2010 1:01:28 PM CDT via TweetDeck
   3/28/93: Under the radar teasefest continues with “Higher Ground”-themed YEM vocal jam. June 8, 2010 1:28:13 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/28/93: Awesome McGrupp/Possum mashup in the first couple minutes of the latter song, then a long jam of mostly Trey wank. June 8, 2010 1:52:19 PM CDT via TweetDeck
3/28/93 verdict: Flush with TV and movie theme teases - slap-happy symptom of long tour, or ‘93 style? Fun, funny, but not spectacular. June 8, 2010 3:41:24 PM CDT via TweetDeck
