  5/23/94 – PORTLAND, OR 
  Pretty much every Phish fan has a love/hate relationship with Trey. Like a baseball manager, he gets an exaggerated amount of praise when things go well and an unfair amount of criticism when things go poorly.  But in the constitutional monarchy of Phish, Trey is the undisputed leader, making setlist calls and, more often than the others, driving the improvisation. Even though he clearly does a pretty good job in this role, many of my favorite Phish moments are, paradoxically, when Trey gets out of the way and allows the rest of the band more space — which explains why I don’t hate the drum kit and the mini-keyboard as much as the median Phish fan*. The more Trey plays the Guitar God, the less engaging I find the music.
  Fortunately, Trey has always been atypical as far as guitar icons go. In the early 90s, when he’s still very much the alpha male (the full band communication they’re famous for now is still embryonic in 1994), he usually resists the urge to take finger-flying solos — I find a lot of his 1999/2000 playing far more masturbatory than these earlier eras. As I’ve already said a bunch here, ‘94 is an interesting jump in Trey’s style towards more atmospheric and effects-driven playing, particularly in darker songs such as Maze and Bowie. But long before that, he had already developed his top anti-solo guitar trick: the ability to be both lead guitarist and rhythm guitarist simultaneously.
  The second segment of this show’s Antelope is a sublime example of this approach. Some Antelopes just climb and climb through tension/release to a delirious peak, some go completely off the rails into new territory. This one does neither, but instead showcases how many brilliant ideas Trey can cram into 5-½ minutes, and how he manages to be both Phish’s conductor and featured soloist simultaneously. Without ever cracking the structure of the song, he lays down chugging rhythms, tosses in long sustained high notes, crafts complex melodic themes (sometimes playing against the very rhythm he’s established), and wraps it all up with the geyser explosion the audience craves. You almost can’t blame Page, Mike, and Fish for not throwing their own ideas into the mix…just keeping pace with Trey’s magic imagination requires incredible concentration and nimbleness. It’s a good reminder not to take Trey for granted, even when he dominates the conversation.
  PS: Of course he’s good at plain ol’ guitar solos too, as the If I Could cooldown after this Antelope demonstrates beautifully.
  * - we’ll see how that attitude holds up when I get to 1995 and 1999.

  The dream of the 90s is alive because it’s still the 90s. 5/23/94, Portland, OR, Civic Auditorium. http://www.phishtracks.com/shows/1994-05-23
  5/23/94: Off to a textbook start with Chalk Dust, Sample, and Foam. Trey biffs the opening of Foam hard, and lets out a frustrated groan.
  5/23/94: According to the Fee performances page, we are in the middle of 18 months of “Trey sang verses through megaphone.” show notes.
  5/23/94: Harmonic Fee outro blended skillfully with the Maze intro, a pretty frequent pairing lately.
  5/23/94: A couple extra times through the Maze ending before Horse. Sorry, this show isn’t giving me much to work with yet.
  5/23/94: At 7 shows, Reba is the biggest “bustout” so far. ’Tis a very nice one, with an unhurried flutter and excellent Page comps.
  5/23/94: A smattering of Wilson chanters in Portland. With so few people doing it, the chant actually sounds kinda off-key.
  5/23/94: Some glitchy robot loops in the calm before Wilson wraps up, then a super-minimal Antelope intro. Much better start to set 2.
  5/23/94: Man. This Antelope jam doesn’t really go sideways, but Trey pours all of his new noisy tricks into it. Head spinning.
  5/23/94: Whispered, creepy Spanglish between Trey and Fish over the start of the third section. “Been You To Have Any Cantaloupe?”
  5/23/94: Gloriously phasing If I Could solo, thanks to either the Leslie speaker or a volume pedal.
  5/23/94: I’ll never be comfortable with mid-set PYITEs, but at least they’re starting to give the intro room to breathe.
  5/23/94: The 2nd Landlady segment is a trainwreck. That and the 1st set Foam show just how thin the margin of error is for some Phish songs.
  5/23/94: A bout of whistling in the YEM ambient segment causes some in the crowd to whistle back, which is pretty freaky.
  5/23/94: Weird jazz guitar effect in the YEM jam, quickly abandoned. Lots of electric piano from Page. Maybe they were going for fusion.
  5/23/94: Vocal jam starts wet and gross, but turns into a muttered a cappella Psycho Killer, so all is forgiven.
  5/23/94: There has been at least one song in the acoustic/no-mics setup at 6 of the last 8 shows.
  5/23/94 Final: A really dull first set gets bailed out by the second, especially the flamethrowing Antelope/Cantaloupe. On to the Bay Area.
