speaking of #phish, forgot my 2/5/93 verdict: improv starts to bloom into mid-tour form on Tweezer and Bowie, but show still uneven. 5.5/104:28 PM Sep 14th from web 
2/5/93: realllly long Page solo at the end of Coil, the first on his new piano. I never want those to end (great one at Toyota Park in Aug).11:18 AM Sep 11th from web
2/5/93: Page reprises the strange monk-chant YEM vocal jam melody on his organ before segueing into HYHU. nice little touch there, Leo.10:59 AM Sep 11th from web
2/5/93: those strange “water your team in a beehive” lyrics are back in YEM (see 2/3/93); some serious echo on Page’s organ solo.10:47 AM Sep 11th from web
2/5/93: oh and a Funkytown jam in Tweezer too. why not?10:18 AM Sep 11th from web 
2/5/93: Set II Tweezer picks up from Set I Bowie…two best jams of the tour so far, with peaks and valleys rather than a straight build.10:16 AM Sep 11th from web 
2/5/93: crazy 4-min Bowie intro sounds a bit like “Everything In It’s Right Place,” contains Vibration of Life, secret language.9:48 AM Sep 11th from web 
2/5/93: Note to singalong hataz the latest #phish tour, it’s nothing new - there’s a whole lot of people singing along to Reba in ‘93.9:41 AM Sep 11th from web 
2/5/93: Trey teaches crowd how to do the Landlady dance “in the spirit of the Roseland”; lots of material for @trey_talkshere. #phish9:22 AM Sep 11th from web 
2/5/93: #phish still not quite sure how to handle the “Melt” jam; this one is pretty fierce, but trey hits it a little too riffy and hard.3:44 PM Sep 10th from web  

  #phish project show 3: 2/5/93 Roseland Ballroom, New York, NY. 1st of a two-night Manhattan stand, MSG still a dream.3:20 PM Sep 10th from web
